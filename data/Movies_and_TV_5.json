I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.

Jamele", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\"Humbug?\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Original, Amrerican, Thought Provoking and Unique", "unixReviewTime": 1224892800, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2008"}

Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.

And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content.

Leed \"Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!\"", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "This movie, JOSEPH, is in-depth and interesting. They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading \"The Bible Collection.\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well. These three come in a money-saving collection called THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which is well worth the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Telling of the Story of Joseph! Good Acting!

This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stimulating", "unixReviewTime": 1322870400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2011"}

Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it!

Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's &quot;My God, my God...&quot; speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph.

It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures.

I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.

The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her \"please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear.\" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the \"prostitute\" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.To the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very \"PG-13\" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his \"lover,\" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me). Christianity focuses on the heart before appearances so lets all appreciate this great adaptation of Joseph's life.

Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb dramatization of the Old Testament story of Joseph", "unixReviewTime": 1172620800, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2007"}

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph.

This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.

Almost all of their animation was done in Japan, and this was one completed at Mushi Studios.The animation isn't much more fluid than in their Animagic productions, but it works very well even by today's standards, in which flash is becoming so prevalent in TV cartoons. What makes it stand head and shoulders over most specials is its unerring simplicity, the voice cast (led by Jimmy Durante, Jackie Vernon and Billy DeWolfe) and the rich musical \"house style\" by Maury Laws. More than anything else, perhaps, the design by Paul Coker, Jr. comes across most dramatically in hand-drawn animation and makes Frosty look like a Christmas card come to life.Watching the crisp, linear Coker images (which resemble his work for countless greeting cards and especially MAD magazine) in Blu-ray is a treat. This was either beautifully preserved or painstakingly restored or both. By daughter remarked that it \"looks like it was just made yesterday!\"The \"bonus\" on the disc is Frosty Returns, the 1992 special CBS commissioned years later (though the 1974 Rankin/Bass 'Twas the Night Before Christmas special usually held the ratings in the second half hour following Frosty), was directed by \"Peanuts\" legend Bill Melendez. CBS may have also requested that the special resemble a \"Peanuts\" special because Frosty Returns looks almost identical to a show with Charlie Brown and Snoopy.Frosty Returns is notable for several reasons, including the voice of a very young Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olsen on MadMen) when she was a child actor, a witty script by Oliver Goldstick and Jim Lewis, and a nice supporting cast, especially if you're a SCTV and Saturday Night Live fan (the executive producer was SNL's Lorne Michaels, whose Broadway Video controlled the Rankin/Bass video library at the time).My only quibble is that Frosty Returns either never got the loving care in the vault as it animated predecessor or there was a mastering problem, because there is a lot of \"line noise\" throughout, almost as if it were a VHS tape instead of a Blu-ray! I might guess that since this show is not the main attraction, it didn't matter as much, but you can't miss the flaws when you can see the images so clearly.Other than that, Frosty the Snowman itself on Blu-ray does indeed look like it was made yesterday, rather than over 40 years ago.For more about Rankin/Bass and Frosty, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Frosty, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Frosty the Blu-ray", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2011"}

Mather", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "**SPOILER ALERT**I'll bet just about everybody has seen \"Frosty the Snowman\" at one time or another, and I can see why it's a classic. The animation may not exactly be top-notch (let's face it, Disney's animation was far much better; even in those days), but that's not really what matters. What really matters is the music, the acting, and the story behind the animation.It's the day before Christmas, and a bunch of children get together to make one big snowman. After some debating, they all agree on the name \"Frosty\". They top their wintry creation off with an old top hat discarded by the magician Professor Hinkle, who is just about the worst magician in the world. (He can't even perform a simple card trick, or get a simple rabbit to come out of his hat.) The very second the hat touches Frosty's head, the snowman instantly comes to life. When Professor Hinkle sees that there is some magic in his hat after all, he decides he wants the hat back. The children are simply delighted to be able to talk to and play with their new friend, but when the temperature starts creeping up, Frosty realizes he must go to some place where he will never melt. And what better place to not melt than the North Pole?So, the children take Frosty downtown to the railroad station, and he and one of the children (a small girl named Karen) secretly stow away on a refrigerated box car on a train heading north. Now, a refrigerated box car really is a wonderful place to travel in--but only if one is a snowman. For Karen, who is made of human flesh, it doesn't take long at all for her to start shivering and sneezing with cold. Frosty knows that Karen can't stay in the car for much longer, so he quickly gets the both of them out the second the train comes to a rest stop.But even after they're out of the car, it still does not do Karen any good, for they are now out in the middle of the wilderness, where it is bitterly cold. Frosty realizes that he must get someone to help them out--someone who can get Karen home before she freezes to death, and him to the North Pole before he melts into a puddle. Hocus Pocus (Professor Hinkle's pet rabbit, who decides to tag along with Frosty and Karen) suggests they get Santa Claus to assist them. But Santa doesn't show up until nightfall, and aside from making sure that Karen is warm enough until Santa arrives, Frosty also has to worry about Professor Hinkle, who will stop at nothing to track the travelers down and reclaim possession of his hat.After temporarily giving Professor Hinkle the slip, Frosty and Karen manage to come across a small greenhouse, where a whole bunch of poinsettas (tropical Christmas flowers) are growing. Deciding that it must be very warm and comfortable inside the greenhouse, Frosty carries Karen inside. Karen protests that Frosty will melt if he goes into the greenhouse, and Frosty assures her that he'll only stay inside for a minute. But once they're inside, Professor Hinkle, who by then has caught up with them, shuts the door behind them and locks it. Now all the fiendish magician has to do is wait for Frosty to melt.Eventually Santa Claus shows up, and Hocus Pocus persuades him to help Frosty and Karen. While searching for the two of them, Santa and Hocus Pocus come across the greenhouse--the very same greenhouse in which Frosty and Karen are trapped. Santa quickly unlocks the door, but once he gets inside, a terrible sight meets his eyes: Karen is down on her knees, crying her eyes out, and all that's left of Frosty is an old top hat and a shapeless puddle of water on the floor. Everything looks hopeless at the moment, as you can very well imagine. Santa, however, assures Karen that all is not lost. He tells her that Frosty is not gone for good; for he is made out of Christmas snow, and Christmas snow can never disappear completely. When Karen protests that Frosty was her best friend, Santa surprises her by using his special holiday magic to restore Frosty to the way he was before.Before they can actually bring Frosty back to life with the hat, Professor Hinkle puts his foot down and demands the return of his hat then and there. Santa warns Professor Hinkle to stay away from Frosty, and to never lay so much as a finger on the brim of the hat, otherwise he'll permanently delete the magician from his list and never bring the magician another Christmas gift for the rest of his life. This insinuation hits Professor Hinkle hard, and he complains bitterly that it's not fair, for even evil magicians have to make a living. Santa then tells Professor Hinkle to go home and write \"I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty\" a hundred zillion times, and then maybe (just maybe) he'll find something in his stocking the following morning. Professor Hinkle agrees, and takes off for home as fast as he can, so that he might be able to complete the assignment before the night is over. Santa then places the hat on Frosty's head, and he immediately awakens, much to Karen's delight. Later, Santa takes Karen home, and then he takes Frosty away to the North Pole. Karen hates to say goodbye to Frosty, but Santa promises that he will bring Frosty back to the city every Christmas, and so he does. And every year from then on, Frosty's return is always celebrated with a big Christmas parade.I've watched this movie almost every Christmas for as long as I can remember, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it.

It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.

It begins rather slowly but the last five minutes are absolutely outstanding and worth scanning back to watch a second time.

On the plus side, we have the beautiful music of the Vienna Boys Choir and a story that draws clear lines between good and evil.  On the minus side, the presentation was excessively heavy handed and preachy, especially for very young children.  For a young boy to proclaim repeatedly that he HATES all people is a portrayal of psychologically disturbed behavior.  Going on to explain his motives by illustrating that his parents were murdered does not put this film in the category of festive holiday videos suitable for young children in my view.Regardless of the outcome and moral of the story (that love conquers hate), many of the scenes presented here require mastery of complex emotional concepts that are beyond the sway of most kids younger than about eight to ten years.  Showing scenes of the forceful abduction of a little boy and murder of his parents, animated or not, has great potential to frighten young children who will not fully comprehend that this is intended to be allegorical.Unlike many, I don?t object to the Christian theme.  Religion is a pervasive part of the human condition and it needn?t be censored or excoriated just because it makes certain people uncomfortable.  However, the film is liberal in its use of name-calling and makes numerous highly intolerant value judgments (perhaps we weren?t so enlightened in 1968, but it was abrasive by any standard).Another thing that struck me as wrongheaded is the way giving is presented as a bargaining tool.  The drummer boy doesn?t play his drum as a selfless gift to the baby in the manger; he plays because he wants the baby to heal his lamb.  This turns giving into a transaction, giving only to get something in return.  I will grant that his motives were good, but is transactional love a message we want to send to our kids?Overall, I would rate this film a 5/10.  It is good and instructive for older children and adults, but I would strongly urge parents of children under ten years old to view it before showing it to their children to determine if its themes are suitable for their maturity level.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Too heavy handed for young children", "unixReviewTime": 976665600, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2000"}

In fact, this special is very powerful and emotional, and so different than the other Rankin and Bass classics that highlight Santa, toys, reindeer, and the other stuff that's just supplementary to Christmas. But The Little Drummer Boy gets to the root and core of Christmas, which in the late 1960s was way more socially acceptable. I love this special for its boldness, animation, message, and overall presence. It may seem strange to some, but I find the dated film with raw animation, coupled with darkness, very appealing.

I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.This was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.I suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while.

The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, with character voices by Keenan Wynn and Mickey Rooney.  The music is marvelous and the story is enchanting.  It answers the burning questions we all have about Santa.  Why is he called Kris Kringle?  Why does he wear a red suit and have whiskers?  How did he meet Mrs. Klaus?  How did he come to bring toys to children by going down the chimey and why is his workshop at the North Pole?  What is the origin of Christmas trees and how do reindeer fly?All these great mysteries are revealed in this magical tale about Christmas' most famous and beloved figure.  It follows his life from the time he was an infant all the way to the jolly and rotund fellow we know and love today.This charming story is an excellent addition to any child's holiday collection.

The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation \"on two's and three's\" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.When I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, \"Be Prepared to Pay\" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).Santa Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.In this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says \"It's not even safe here,\" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.Okay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray.For more about Rankin/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Santa Claus comes to Blu-ray", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2011"}

When Santa grows up, he decides that he has to make the trip to town, but first he has to go through the territory of the winter warlock (socialism-regulation).

When Santa gets to town, he befriends the town schoolteacher (education) and is branded an outlaw for giving out toys (how capitalist of him).

Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.This fact aside, &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot; is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.All the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.The songs are excellent, from the familiar &quot;Santa Claus is Coming To Town&quot; to the lovely &quot;My World Is Beginning Today&quot; sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)The script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.This has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show.

It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.Produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic \"Santa Claus is Comin' To Town.\" These include \"First Toymaker To the King,\" \"Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),\" \"Put One Foot in Front of the Other,\" \"My World is Beginning Today,\" and \"What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol).\" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.The story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin).

After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \"Where did Santa's suit come from?\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion \"Animagic\" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as \"One Foot in Front of the Other\". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD.

Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word \"Claus\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful \"My World is Beginning Today\" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.In addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.Whether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed. This remains one of the more original holiday specials.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Santa Claus: Behind the legend", "unixReviewTime": 1134000000, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2005"}

One hour TV specials from the sixties and seventies have gone through some edits over the years, most notably the Rankin Bass specials, such as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and this: Santa Claus is Comin To Town.I watched this one on TV the other night with my kid. He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.But there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.It is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.But thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials.

Sam the Snowman (voiced by Burl Ives) brilliantly narrates the tale of an awkward reindeer and his struggle with discrimination. Along the way, he sings a number of holiday classics such as \"Silver and Gold,\" \"Holly Jolly Christmas,\" and of course - \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\".The story begins when Rudolph's father, Donner, tries to cover up his son's shiny, bright red nose with a disguise. When Rudolph attends a flight training school for young reindeer, he encounters Clarice - a young doe who thinks that Rudolph is cute. This revelation causes Rudolph to leap into the air and fly around the sky like a seasoned aviator. But when he lands, the nose disguise falls off and Rudolph's red honker is exposed to the scorn and ridicule of the young bucks in flight school. Clarice is the only one who doesn't view Rudolph as an outcast freak, but her father quickly escorts her out of the presence of such a \"monster\".Following this episode, Rudolph runs away only to meet up with an outcast Elf named Hermey who has committed the unforgivable sin of not wanting to make toys. Contrary to the social conventions of his time, Hermey wants to be a dentist. Feeling unwanted, Rudolph and Hermey decide to run away together. But in due time, they encounter the dangerous Abominable Snow Monster - a giant, hairy beast who crushes anyone who leaves Christmastown. Aiding in their rescue is Yukon Cornelius, a burly prospector who chops off a piece of ice with his pick ax, allowing Rudolph, Hermey, and himself to float away from the Abominable Snow Monster (who can't swim).After floating through the night, the three characters discover The Land of Misfit Toys - an island of handicapped, screwed-up toys rejected by elf quality-control managers and forced to live away their best years in an icy wasteland. Our three heroes can relate to the misfit toys, and Rudolph promises to inform Santa of their status the next time he sees him.When Rudolph sneaks away in the middle to return home, he meets up with Clarice (who ran away from home to search for him), and the two of them get cornered by the Abominable Snow Monster. But Yukon Cornelius faces down the Monster, and together with Hermey, he coaxes the beast into a trap - where Hermey neutralizes the Monster by pulling out his teeth.Meanwhile, Christmastown is covered with a thick fog, and Santa ponders the cancellation of Christmas. But when he sees Rudolph's bright red nose glowing in his workshop, Santa asks Rudolph to guide his sleigh through the night. With Rudolph taking the lead, Santa swoops down on Christmas Eve just in time to rescue the depressed residents of The Land of Misfit Toys and deliver them all to expectant boys and girls who will love them for who they are.This breakthrough Claymation classic is essential for any child's Christmas experience (and that of adults who grew up watching much-anticipated annual holiday special on TV). That's why this ranks as a definite \"must-see\" by any standard. But undoubtedly, we all owe a special thanks to Montgomery Ward - the giant retail chain that created Rudolph as part of a promotional gimmick one fabled Christmas season decades ago.

{"reviewerID": "A35XUI9HGMAJEX", "asin": "0307514161", "reviewerName": "Carlisle Wheeling", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Always a great holiday classic, this special strikes a chord with anyone who has ever been rejected for being different and longs for acceptance on their own terms.  I should know, having been picked on most of my life for having undiagnosed ADD.  Rudolph is the son of the famous Donnar, who is ashamed to find out his son has a red shiny nose that glows and gives off a horrific, wailing beep, so he tries to hide it by packing mud over it when a visiting, arrogant Santa disapproves.  Well, shame on Santa, and shame on the others--especially the reindeer clique--who picked on him.  They don't even take into consideration how well he can fly, or that he is a good \"person\" with a good heart.  All they see is his nose.  Fortunately, like any misfit, Rudolph has some allies in his mother, Clarice, Ukorn Cornelius, and Herbie the elf--a veritable misfit himself in Santa's workshop--who wants to be \"a...a dentist.\"Due to lack of acceptance, Rudolph and Herbie set off on their own to find their special calling, and meet up with gold prospector Ukorn and his pack of sled dogs.  Ukorn knows no fear, and is the only one who isn't afraid of the Abominable Snowman.  PCers lighten up!  Herbie removing his teeth was better than killing him, and the Abominable was indiscriminate about where he got his lunch.  Was Herbie removing his teeth awful in comparison?  I think not.The group lands on the Island of Misfit toys, ruled by a great and kindly lion king who wants Santa to find homes for them, and rightly so.  Everyone wants to be accepted and loved for who they are, don't they?  That is the lesson in this wonderful yuletide story for young and old alike, and it always puts most of us in the Christmas mood.  Did you ever notice how people are more accepting of those who are different around the holidays, and then they revert back to the way they treated them previously?  This story is about how anyone can change--even the \"bumble\"--that acceptance is a worldwide theme, and that's what the lesson is in this wonderful old classic.  It doesn't mean you should only make exceptions on the holidays, however, but you should be accepting all year long.  The spirit of Christmas should last throughout the year in kindness and tolerance of difference, which makes this appropriate for children of all ages.  It's a great lesson full of good old classic songs, and Burl Ives makes a great snowman narrator.It's obvious Rankin Bass put a lot of care into this one, and I also recommend Santa Claus is Comin' to Town along with it.  They don't make specials like this anymore, and I know 3/4 of the dialog due to repeated watching!  Good old Christmas classics never go out of style when they're done right, and that's the reason adults still love to watch this one with their kids.  Pass this one on to your kids and emphasize the lesson here about being generous to your fellow man and animal.  Also, have a happy holiday!Dedicated to the memory of my late brother Mark, who always loved this when we were kids and beyond.Sincerely, Carlisle.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Did I Ever Tell You About Bumbles?

At least, it does after the last five minutes, when Rudolph saves everyone's butts from...er...fog.The story begins when Rudolph is born. To his parents' horror, he has a flashing red nose. When Santa, the cruel despot of Christmastown (seriously -- in this show, he's a jerk), makes no attempt to hide his disgust, Rudolph's father, Donner, displays some dubious parenting techniques by forcing the young deer to disguise his luminous snout. Unfortunately, Rudolph's shameful deformity is discovered by the other young reindeer, who laugh and call him names. One of these cretins is named Fireball - he's got a single wisp of blond hair and freckles, so he really shouldn't be one to talk.When Rudolph is cast out from Christmastown, he meets some new friends:Hermey - a toy-hating elf with an oral fixation, and a finger-wave hairdo that would make Conan O'Brien jealous. Hermey loses his job because he wants to live an alternate lifestyle. How PC.Yukon Cornelius - a burly prospector seeking to increase his personal wealth. Interestingly, he carries a gun. Yukon helps Rudolph defeat a giant snow-monster. The monster (who is white) represents The Man, crushing anyone who does not bow to conformity (by staying safely in Christmastown).Misfit Toys - a bunch of toys that nobody wants: a boat that doesn't float, a train with square wheels, a squirt-gun filled with jelly, etc. Frankly, I think Santa's workshop needs better Quality Control, if they're turning out junk like this. Besides, I can think of a few seventh graders who could make the most of a jelly-gun.Clarice - a doe-eyed...well...doe, with Revlon lashes and a bow in her hair. She's lovely and tolerant, and the most under-developed character in the story.While this enchanting tale is a family-favorite it fails as an origin story, neglecting to explain why Rudolph's nose glows. It's obviously a genetic mutation, but we never learn the mechanism behind it. Does it give off heat? Why does it make that feeble whistling sound? Is it any more horrifying than the fact that Santa can go from skinny to fat in the course of one day?It's also disconcerting that, by story's end, Rudolph has reached maturity (with tall, pointed antlers), but his voice has not changed. Perhaps reindeer puberty is unpredictable, but Rudolph is the only adult male who doesn't sound like J. Jonah Jameson.Still, I recommend this Claymation Classic for anyone.

{"reviewerID": "A1FDW1SPYKB354", "asin": "0307514161", "reviewerName": "David Von Pein", "helpful": [14, 14], "reviewText": "First televised on NBC-TV on Sunday, December 6, 1964 (but usually associated with CBS-TV due to that network's many airings of the program throughout the succeeding years), the animated color TV Special &#34;Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer&#34; has now turned forty years of age (as of this writing), and has endured for all those years as an annual staple in many American homes.The DVD edition I'm reviewing here is the one issued by &#34;Sony Wonder&#34; and &#34;Golden Books Family Entertainment&#34; (1-Disc version). It provides a very good-looking Full Frame (1.33:1) video image of the perennial &#34;Rudolph&#34; Christmas Special; with a Dolby Digital soundtrack recorded in 2-channel (original) Mono.This particular version of &#34;Rudolph&#34; is quite unique actually, in that it is the &#34;unaltered&#34; version of the TV Special, as it aired originally in 1964. Which means that one song which has been routinely cut out of subsequent broadcasts of the program is presented uncut within this DVD version. That song being &#34;We're A Couple Of Misfits&#34;, sung by Rudolph and dentist-to-be &#34;Hermey&#34; near the beginning of the show. This song was replaced in 1965 with the &#34;Fame And Fortune&#34; song instead.The alternate song used in that scene (&#34;Fame And Fortune&#34;) is included, however, as a separate Bonus Feature on this DVD. .... To tell you the truth, I prefer the &#34;Fame & Fortune&#34; number to the original &#34;Misfits&#34; tune. And I can see why the producers of the Special decided to make the switch during the second broadcast of the program in 1965. &#34;F&F;&#34; is a better ditty, IMO. And, obviously, others thought so as well. Hence, the substitution.This DVD contains the complete, uncut version of &#34;Rudolph&#34; (with a total run time of 51 minutes, 32 seconds). This is significant (and most welcome), because after the first few broadcasts on network TV, as we all know, many cuts and edits were made to the original print, so that more and more commercials could be jammed into the one-hour network timeslot over the years. It's doubtful we'll ever encounter this original &#34;51-minute&#34; version on network television again, due to the ever-increasing sponsors' demands for prime-time air time.All of the rarely-seen snippets of the &#34;Rudolph&#34; Special are re-inserted into this full-length DVD version -- clips like: the &#34;Peppermint&#34; scene at the tail-end of the special, where Yukon Cornelius discovers &#34;a peppermint mine! Yahooo!&#34; .... And: the complete musical numbers (&#34;Jingle, Jingle, Jingle!&#34; and &#34;We Are Santa's Elves&#34;) are fully intact on the DVD; whereas, in many chopped-up prints, one (or both) of these songs have either been severely truncated or cut out entirely. It's nice to be able to see the &#34;whole&#34; show via this nicely-done &#34;Sony&#34; DVD release.This disc has a few nice add-on bonus supplements, too. In addition to the aforementioned bonus song (&#34;Fame And Fortune&#34;), there's also a Rudolph trivia game, an original TV promo, some ads for other &#34;Golden Books&#34; holiday DVD titles, and a fun and informative 11-minute &#34;introduction&#34; by producer/creator Arthur Rankin.In addition, you can access English Subtitles in two different ways on this disc -- there are the traditional &#34;captions&#34;/(subtitles) that can be turned on at the bottom of the screen. Plus, this DVD offers what is called &#34;Read-Speak Action Captions&#34;, which show the words on the screen in a unique, 3-D kind of fashion, displaying the words in large print right beside the mouths of each character speaking, one word at a time. An interesting alternative to the normal captioning process.Chapter breaks are also included on this disc, with a whopping total of 27 &#34;Scene Selections&#34;! My goodness, some three-hour movie DVDs don't have this many Chapter Stops! :) ** = NOTE: The &#34;Read-Speak&#34; Captioned version of &#34;Rudolph&#34; (which can be accessed via the Bonus Features area) does not have any &#34;Chapter&#34; breaks included.An added word or two about the &#34;TV Promo&#34; on this disc --- This is a nice little bonus, which runs for 59 seconds and exhibits very good color and overall picture quality. It's an original 1966 NBC-TV promo that informs the viewers that &#34;Rudolph is coming on Sunday, December 4th, on the General Electric Fantasy Hour&#34; program.A word about the DVD Menus ..... I'm not a big fan of &#34;Animated Menus&#34; on DVDs, but this disc's Menu system is an exception. For some reason, I really like these Menus, which offer up cheery music and cute animated sequences. The Main Menu puts the viewer right into the Christmas spirit, featuring falling snow, a decorated Christmas tree, and &#34;Rudolph&#34; looking skyward, complete with batting eyelids and a bright glowing nose. While the various Sub-Menus also have animated moving pictures and a &#34;falling snow&#34; background as well. Each Sub-Menu features a different character from the &#34;Rudolph&#34; Special.Some additional &#34;Rudolph&#34; Notes and Trivia and Miscellaneous Ramblings :-) ..................&#62;&#62; The voice talent for &#34;Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer&#34; was supplied by Burl Ives (Narrator/&#34;Sam&#34;), Billie Mae Richards (&#34;Rudolph&#34;), Paul Soles (&#34;Hermey&#34;), Larry Mann (&#34;Yukon&#34;), and Alfie Scopp (&#34;Head Elf&#34;).&#62;&#62; I hadn't realized this trivial tidbit until recently ...... Comet (the reindeer coach) was voiced by Don Adams (of &#34;Get Smart&#34; TV fame).&#62;&#62; I've often wondered how many little kids who have watched this &#34;Rudolph&#34; Special were suddenly scared to death that Christmas might be &#34;cancelled&#34; (as feared in the show due to foul weather). LOL!&#62;&#62; Has anyone (besides me) ever noticed with amusement that the gruff voice of the &#34;Head Elf&#34; dramatically changes, somehow, just before he begins to direct his &#34;Elf Chorus&#34; in the song &#34;We Are Santa's Elves&#34;? Throughout the majority of the show, Mr. Head Elf is the very coarse-sounding 'meanie' -- when he dishes out some of my favorite lines from the show, such as: &#34;Now you come to Elf Practice and learn how to wiggle your ears, and chuckle warmly, and go &#34;hehe&#34; and &#34;hoho&#34;, and important stuff like that! A dentist! Good grief!&#34; .... And yet, in the &#34;chorus&#34; scene, his voice changes completely. He sounds a bit wimpish when he utters: &#34;Now let's try out the new elf song I wrote; and remember, it's for Santa.&#34; (LOL!) This sudden and drastic vocal-cord switch always cracks me up when I watch this program.------------------------------The &#34;Rudolph&#34; TV Special is truly an American tradition. A must-see each December.

Walker", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewText": "I always loved the anti-authoritarian messages of the 60's-era Rankin Bass films. \"Rudolph\" is probably my favorite.  Its sense of history, and sly use of metaphor, are unrivaled among holiday specials. Santa is a case in point: the brash young rebel of \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" has aged, like so many real-life revolutionaries, into a complacent, jackbooted despot. He has mislaid the flame of revolution, which is now in the hands (or rather the nose) of young Rudolph.To some degree, the tale is predictable, with a familiar set-up. A rebel-hero requires that the status quo (or ruling party) be, if not evil, then extremely jaded and misguided. Santa, the tyrant of Christmas Town, who has Castro's beard and pomposity, has built an austere, Walachia-like kingdom on the sweatshop labor of elves in the unregulated North. He seems the ideal villain-a capitalist straw man from a Socialist tract-and you eagerly await his downfall.Of course, Jolly Saint Nick can never be deposed. As a young man, he once swept the Burghermeister into the flames like so much tinsel, but in the centuries since he has become the face of a nation and seems destined to fade, like Castro, into white hairs and senility. Thus, the tension-how will they resolve it?Rudolph, shunned in his homeland, reaches maturity (like the prophets of old) on the howling wastes, where he regards the hollowness of Santa's regime.  Like Simon in \"Lord of the Flies,\" he realizes that the Abominable (the State bogeyman) is, in reality, just some harmless bugaboo, the product and victim of government hype. In a stirring climax, Rudolph the Red, assisted by an inner circle of misfits and weirdoes (including the defanged Abominable), returns to Christmas Town to confront Santa. He knows that the old regime, beset by storms and malaise, is doomed. What follows demonstrates his tactical genius: the venerable Santa will become the Revolution's impotent figurehead; Rudolph, its scorching beacon. The old king, recalling the glory of his own Putsch, hands the reins of power to the young firebrand, who quickly liberates the deformed misfit inmates of a floating Bastille (imprisoned \"for their own good\" by an imperious, leonine, eagle-winged warden) and unleashes them on society.

Who has ever heard of a red-nosed reindeer, you say? No one, until now. Rudolph is the only reindeer with such a nose, which is a problem, considering he can't join in any of the reindeer games, and is shunned by everyone in Christmastown. But when he meets Hermey, and outcast elf, and Yukon Cornelius, they escape from Christmastown, and the ridicule, and, while trying to avoid the Bumble (the Abominable Snow Monster), the three friends come across the Island of Misfit Toys, where they meet many toys who are looking for a person to love them. But one year, when Christmas has been officially cancelled, and Santa Claus can't find a way to guide his sleigh through the blizzard, Rudolph returns to Christmastown, where Santa Claus calls upon him to guide his sleigh, and where he becomes a world-renown hero.For everyone who has sung the song, the official story, and movie, is here. Fans young and old will relish in the exact similarities between the song and the movie; and the sweet relationship that Rudolph develops with his friends Hermey the Elf, Yukon Corenlius, and even the Bumble. Not to mention the little romance he develops with a beautiful little doe. This movie isn't all fun and games. It also holds a message: being different makes you special.

Taylor \"GFT\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Founded in 1960 by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass, Rankin/Bass followed in the footsteps of such stop-motion animators as Ray Harryhousen--but with less budget.  Although the company made quite a few feature films over the years, with the 1967 THE MAD MONSTER PARTY probably the best known, they were most famous for their seasonal television specials.  These included the 1964 RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER, which has been televised on network television every year at Christmas since its debut.Obviously inspired by the song by the 1939 song, the story veers in several creative directions.  Not only does Rudolph have a glowing red nose, his father attempts to conceal it, and even Santa rejects Rudolph because of it.  This story line is combined with the tale of elf Hermey, who dislikes making toys and wants to be a dentist.  Rejected for who they are, Rudolph and Hermey flee the north pole--and eventually stumble upon the Island of Misfit Toys, where unwanted toys are gathered and will remain until some little girl or boy actually wants one of them.  Still later, the pair encounter Yukon Cornelius, who helps them defeat the \"Bumble,\" a version of the abominable snowman.  Rudolph and Hermey return home, where both now find acceptance; Yukon Cornelius joins them, leading the Bumble, who he has converted into a helpful beast.  When a violent snow storm threatens to postpone Christmas, Rudolph uses his nose to light Santa's way, and after a quick stop to pick up the misfit toys for a happily-ever-after Christmas delivery, Santa is on his way.The stop-motion is hardly on the same level as that of KING KONG or EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, but it has a certain innocent charm, and the puppets are truly smile inducing.  The show also includes a number of truly enjoyable Christmas songs, two of which are performed by Burl Ives as the narrating snowman and which went on to a broader popularity: \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Sliver and Gold.\"  The DVD release is not pristine, but it is extremely good, and children of all ages will enjoy the show.

For example, all of the reindeers on Santa's sleigh are male and the sole purpose of the female reindeer is to stand around and look pretty; or my favourite part, at two points in the film, Mrs Claus tells Santa to eat more because children don't want a skinny Santa.Having said all of that, I do like \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" very much. I saw this film many times as a child and loved it then (and no, I didn't end up becoming overweight nor did I end up believing that females are incapable of doing anything useful in life), and as a 27 year old, I still think that \"Rudolph\" is one of the cutest Christmas films there is.

Still the all-time champ, Rudolph is the longest-running holiday special in television history, running annually since 1964, mostly on CBS and NBC. You can get hung up on the modest scope of the stop-motion Animagic figures, elemental sets and limited effects, but you can't deny its power. There is simply an engaging quality about the production that charms every generation, regardless of how high-tech things become. Production designer Anthony Peters deserves more attention for his creations, which we see almost everywhere today -- even the lettering is widely imitated.At its core, the story is about being \"different,\" and how those differences become strengths. For a show aimed at children's, the characters can be downright cruel (this particular Santa, besides appearing to have an eating disorder, shows such displeasure he'd be right at home sitting next to Donald Trump on The Apprentice).If you view the special in its historic context, during the civil rights movement, suddenly Rudolph is a victim of prejudice -- Clarice's father won't let his daughter be seen with him. Maybe that's reading too much into the story, but it makes one wonder if some members of '60s households realized they were watching or just dismissed it as a cute kid's show. Probably the latter.As a cultural icon, you can't dismiss the influence this single special had on so much that followed it. Many of today's greatest names in animation have either cited it as a favorite (along with other Rankin/Bass films) or slipped its lore into their own work. Like The Wizard of Oz, elements of Romeo Muller's script have become part of our vernacular, from Charlie in the Box to Hermie the Dentist.On Blu-ray, of course you can see the handmade quality of the animation in all its glory -- as well as details you may have missed, like Clarice's touch of blush or Fireball's freckles. AND, the long-omitted \"Peppermint mine\" scene has been included. If you've ever wondered if there was more to Yukon Cornelius' quest for riches, you'll see it just before Santa goes off to pick up the misfit toys.For more about Rankin/Bass and Rudolph, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Rudolph, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Rudolph, the Blu-ray Reindeer", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2011"}

(Less well known--if not totally UNKNOWN--at that time would have been the orignial 1939 story by Robert L. May.)  Nowadays, of course, kids grow up with both the song and the now annually broadcast special and probably don't really have an inkling of the history of the tale.But literal minded kid that I was, I remember being a little perplexed that Rudolph's father was DONNER in the animated version.  Everything else I'd ever read (including the annual comic book edtions) suggested that Rudolph and Donner were simply, well, TEAMmates--and contemporaries.  I recall, as well, having some ambivalence about the Hermey subplot.  Yes, it drove home the \"misfit\" theme of the story by providing Rudolph with an actual friend and kindred spirit, but, I mean, c'mon, an elf who wants to be a DENTIST??  Shouldn't they just be magically protected from something as mundane as tooth decay to begin with?But like most 60s kids, I was still kinda taken with the production, whatever my reservations.  However you tell it, the RUDOLPH saga is a classic \"Ugly Duckling\" story, a genre just about every kid identifies with on some level.  (Who doesn't feel misunderstood and unappreciated?)  And in an era when anti-bullying messages are proliferating (and,  I sincerely hope, are being heard),  it does a body good to remember one such classic tale from an earlier era.Some kids may be taken aback to learn that, in this version, even Santa is insensitive (AND, oddly enough, kinda SKINNY most of the time, 'til Mrs. Claus fattens him up anyway).  Santa's initial reaction is to dismiss Rudolph as a potential drafts-reindeer, and rather summarily at that.  But even in the original song, come to think of it, there's no indication that Santa's interest in Rudolph is anything but utilitarian.  You never saw him scolding the other reindeer for not letting \"poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.\" If it hadn't been for that foggy Christmas Eve...I've often wondered if the stop motion animation of this version of RUDOLPH might not seem too primitive and awkward for the current crop of tykes out there, weaned as they are on whizzbang computer generated special effects.  Well, a few years ago, I watched the DVD with my niece and nephew, and they were captivated with it.  That was heartening,  RUDOLPH is a warm-hearted, compassionate tale.  It's good to know that it still speaks to children.PS--Oh, yeah, and the kids get to discover Burl Ives' songs too.

Johnny Marks ... and recorded (reluctantly) by Gene Autry.The first animated film \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" was a Max Fleischer cartoon of about 1951.  In that one, Rudolph lives in a reindeer village far from the North Pole, and is discovered sleeping by Santa ... who wakes Rudolph and asks him to help.  Rudolph saves the day, and is later honored in a stadium (in his home town) and named \"Commander in Chief\".This version (the Johnny Marks one here) is about a hundred times better.  I love the puppets here ... though they must have required a lot of work (and about a million photos) ... but it is the story that, I believe, captures our hearts.The credit for that (the story) goes to Mr. May, but also to a guy named Romeo Muller ... who filled out and embellished the original tale for this, the 1964 made-for-television movie.Having Rudolph be a heartbroken misfit ... who prevails ... is an excellent lesson for many of us who were (and are) in the same predicament as kids... and adding in Hermey and Clarice and Yukon Cornelius (and even the snow monster) ... just makes it a wonderful and meaningful story.And the songs are very excellent.  Johnny Marks did high quality work here (as the song writer) ... as many of them are still being heard (at Christmas time) today ... some 40 years later.This is just a great movie for everybody ... children and children at heart ... to watch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Christmas Movie", "unixReviewTime": 1126224000, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2005"}

The misfit toys solicit `aww's as usual and we actually found ourselves rooting for the ultimate misfit, that poor prisoner of his station, the bumbling abominable snowman.

As for special features, there's the \"Fame and Fortune\" song, which replaced the \"We're a Couple of Misfits\" reprise that was in the original broadcast in 1965. It was a nice touch restoring the original print to the original broadcast, not the chopped-up versions that followed in years since.

Original broadcast version, in its entirety. \"Fame and Fortune\" included as a bonus feature, and there's an interesting bit with Arthur Rankin, one half of the Rankin & Bass team (think Pixar, but in the 60s and with puppets instead of computers). Also included is a spanish language track, AND an original 60s television promo for the film. Colorful menus and trivia game. Oh yeah, and great movie.Minuses: The color and picture could be more polished, the sound is about a B+. Not much in the way of bonus features or featurettes.

But where the 1964 production from Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. achieved greatness was in the creativeness it showed with the supporting cast. The story is narrated by Sam the Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives (who sang the second most popular version of the song after Gene Autry's orignal), and Rudolph (Billie Mae Richards) becomes friends with both Hermey (Paul Soles), the elf who marches to his own drummer, and Yukon Cornelius (Larry D. Mann), the prospector. However, the most unforgettable characters in this story are the toys from the Island of Misfit Toys: Charlie-in-the-Box, the Spotted Elephant, and the others, along with their leader, King Moonracer.The result is a much deeper version of the story than was even hinted at in the lyrics of Johnny Marks' classic Christmas song. We all now how the story is going to end on that foggy Christmas eve, so it is everything leading up to that fateful night that is where this story gets its deserved reputation as Rudolph is not the only one who ends up having their life take a turn for the better, as even the Abominable Snowman finds he can put the finishing touches on a perfect Christmas. Besides, how often does a dentist get to be the hero in a Christmas story?Bass-Rankin took at similar approach in 1970 with \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town,\" and while that animated holiday show is pretty good and worth watching each Christmas season, this one is better. If you have been in a store and seen the looks of pure delight on people's faces when they see the line of toy figures associated with \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" then you already know this.

I will assume you have seen this before so my review will be limited to the video and audio quality of the transfer.\"Rudolph\" shows up on Blu Ray in a flimsy eco case (el cheapo, mostly air) with festive artwork. The disc itself is nicely silk screened in full color and mine came with a very pleasing slipcover over the main case. Despite the 25GB disc, the feature is presented in 1080p with a nice healthy bit rate, much higher than many big name movie releases sport. Since it is less than one hour long a BD 50 disc was not needed.This is one Blu Ray I was really looking forward to seeing and was hoping I would not be let down.  I WASN'T !!  Contrary to some other reviews I have read I am here to tell you that this Blu Ray transfer of \"Rudolph\" is simply beautiful.  It is a MAJOR upgrade from the best quality DVD version you can find.  The colors are gorgeous, vibrant and strong.  Print damage is VERY minimal with my biggest complaint being a few stray hairs that show up for a few seconds perhaps 2 or 3 times during the almost one hour presentation.Remember that this was a \"Stop Motion Animation\" feature. This being the case you will notice the brightness flicker from time to time. This is NOT a defect in the transfer, it is an expected artifact from the process originally used to create this Christmas masterpiece.  The same goes for minor color fluctuations. All the artifacts that occurred due to the now primitive stop motion animation process are amplified on this release but don't let that scare you off.  It REALLY looks good folks. After seeing this year after year for 47 years , first in Black and White on our old Magnavox, later in color on our old Zenith, and lately upscaled to 1080p from my current DVD copy,  I was THRILLED to see \"Rudolph\" looking this good. WOW!Rudolph is presented with chapter breaks (w/thumbnails) and a set-up screen that lets you switch between a few other languages. This is a bare bones release with NO extras at all. The English audio is presented in Dolby 5.1 TruHD. Don't expect an Avatar type mix here! Rudolph was originally mixed in mono and except for a few special audio effects (snow, wind, etc) most of the sound will emanate from your center channel.  For this title I recommend switching your surround amp to \"Stereo\" and using the two front speakers for best results. Either way you wish to do it, the track is lossless, clear and as good as you will ever hear it. Dialogue is clear, songs all sound fine and it IS a noticeable bump in quality compared to my DVD version.If you are like me and have loved this film over the years then this Blu Ray release of \"Rudolph\" will not disappoint. Never in a million years did I ever think I would be able to enjoy this classic with such a beautiful , colorful and CLEAR picture!  This is not computer animation and won't look like Shrek, but it IS a true classic and \"Rudolph\" totally delivers on Blu Ray!

May and directed by Kizo Nagashima and Larry Roemer, \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" is just as engaging and entertaining for children today as it was when it was first released in 1964.  The story is about a young reindeer named Rudolph (voice by Billie Mae Richards) who is teased and jaunted by other reindeer because he has a glowing red nose instead of a little black nose like every other reindeer.  Seeing himself as a misfit, he decides to run away and is joined by an elf named Hermey (voice by Paul Soles).  Hermey also considers himself a misfit because he wants to be dentist instead of a toy-maker like the other elves.  They meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (voice by Larry D.

The story is also narrated by Sam the Snowman, whose voice was done by Burl Ives (1909-1995).Songs in this adorable children's fantasy include:* \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)* \"Jingle Jingle Jingle\" (5 stars, performed by Santa Claus).* \"We Are Santa's Elves\" (5 stars, performed by Santa's elves.)* \"There's Always Tomorrow\" (5+ stars, performed by Clarice.)* \"We're A Couple of Misfits\" (5 stars, performed by Rudolph and Hermey.)* \"Fame and Fortune\" (4.5 stars, performed by Rudolf and Hermey.)* \"Silver and Gold\" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)* \"The Most Wonderful Day of the Year\" (4.5 stars, performed by the misfit toys.)* \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)Overall, I rate \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" with 5 out of 5 stars.

A good place to start is Rudolph himself. Rudolph is wonderfully voiced by Billie May Richards and is an easy character to root for right from the start. We see a wonderful character progression from Rudolph being mistreated by everyone in Christmastown to him being on the run to him growing older and realizing he has to face his troubles rather than run from them and that he must go home to the big moment where Santa says \"Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight.\"  Rudolph's journey is just fantastic. What the producers have also done with this show is expanded on the misfit theme and added other characters not in the song to obtain a reasonable length show. There's a misfit elf and a wonderful collection of \"misfit toys\" on the Island of Misfit toys. I especially like the train with square wheels on its caboose.

Barred from attending reindeer school because of this difference, he ultimately discovers an island where 'misfit toys' with various deformities (a choo-choo with square wheels..etc) have been involuntarily isolated.Technically they are among their own kind so they should be happy, but they are instead gloomy. Unable to fulfil the role of what a toy SHOULD be doing, they instead feel lonely and punnished--wanting to escape the island and travel with Santa. They know that if they were like 'normal' toys, children would play with them.Joined by an elf-dentist named Hermey and a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (who does not add much to the story), Rudolph himself saves the day. And he maintains the love of a doe named Clarice who had always loved him for who he was, even when his own family was publically ashamed of his difference.Finally, it's important to note that Fireball and the other reindeer who teased him as 'children' could not even make Santa's prestigious team.

Arthur Rankin's totally captivating stop motion animation was a bench mark for everything that has come since and even with all of our modern computer technology nothing could come close to the beauty of the creations here. The story of that most famous of reindeers, the one and only Rudolph who's initial drawback of having a shiny nose eventually becomes his chief asset, is beautifully told in a music filled special narrated by Burl Ives in a perfect piece of casting as Sam the snowman. This special has quite rightly become a Christmas instituation every year since its initial release and appeals equally to both children and adults with its timeless message of tolerance and acceptance of all who are different. It has happily now been given a deserving release onto DVD back in its original form complete with deleted songs and a superb restoration.Based on the immortal Christmas song by Johnny Marks who was also responsible for all the lyrics in this television production, \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\", tells us the entire story of this most famous reindeer and how he became Santa's best helper. Born with a strange glowing nose that invites the ridicule of all who know him, Rudolph sees his whole position in life ruined when he is passed over to become part of Santa's team of reindeers. Despite having the affection of young Doe Clarice, Rudolph sets out to find a proper life for himself and along the way not only meets some colourful characters but also encounters some real danger. Rudolph teams up first with Hermey, an elf who like Rudolph is considered an outcast in his community as he doesn't enjoy making toys and wants instead to become a dentist. The pair soon join up with eccentric prospector Yukon Cornelius on his travels which involve escaping the clutches of the Abominable Snow Monster and visiting the strange island of misfit toys who are waiting for Santa to find homes for all of the unwanted toys gathered on the island. Rudolph however returns to the North Pole just prior to Christmas to find Santa in an absolute state about not being able to do the present deliveries on Christmas Eve as a terrible blizzard has blown up making conditions impossible to travel in all over the world. For once Rudolph's shiny nose is viewed as an asset and Santa finally sees that only with Rudolph's help guiding his sleigh will his deliveries be able to be made. Rudolph thus wins total acceptance with Hermey also finally getting a chance to do what he really wants in dentistry with even the Abominable Snow Monster finding himself a useful role in being tall enough to  place the Christmas Star on Santa's Christmas tree at the happy conclusion.\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\", has been the inspiration for countless animators since 1964 with Tim Burton in his latest effort \"The Corpse Bride\", being the latest to pay homage to the genius of Arthur Rankin's work. I personally feel \"Rudolph\", is the crowning glory of the many fine animated specials produced by Rankin and his team. The characters in the story all have their own distinct personalities from the timid Rudolph, to the colourful Yukon Cornelius, through to the harried Santa and Mrs. Claus. Despite the limitations of this early animation it is a supreme achievement that these characters are able to convey identifiable qualities to the viewing audience. Particulary endearing are of course Rudolph's character who only yearns for the acceptance of his peers which I'm sure we can all identify with, and Hermy who is also in the same situation. It was a wonderful idea to have the character of Sam the Snowman (who seems to have been the inspiration for the later Frosty the Snowman), present to narrate the story and they could not have found a more perfect performer than singer/actor Burl Ives to take on the voice of this jolly character. Ives at the film's conclusion gets the opportunity to sing the immortal title song which I feel is synonymous with the Christmas season and for which he as a performer would be forever after associated with. As befitting a family Christmas special \"Rudolph\", contains some other charming musical numbers as well such as \"Holly Jolly Christmas\", and \"Silver and Gold\", that are sure to delight old and young viewers alike.Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is such a Christmas fixture that I couldn't imagine the festive season without a screening of this television classic. I find the special so enchanting not only because of its breathtaking animation and lovable characters but also by the charming innocence of the whole story, something which is sadly missing in much of our present day television programming. Outstanding Christmas specials that still entertain forty one years after they first appeared are few and far between and if you haven't had the joy of seeing the story of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer in Arthur Rankin's television masterpiece then do yourself and your family a favour and treat them to a screening of it next Christmas.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Immortal Christmas Classic Featuring The Most Famous Reindeer Of All", "unixReviewTime": 1136332800, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2006"}

Well, \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" does exactly that by using the \"misfits\" theme to appeal to such a wide audience.For a basic plot summary, \"Rudolph\" sees the young reindeer with the glowing red nosed mocked for his differences and unable to \"join in any reindeer games\".  Without any chance of joining Santa's sleigh team, Rudolph (along with fellow misfit Elf Herbie, who wants to be a dentist instead of making toys) embarks out into the wilderness himself, encountering an Abominable Snow Monster and a hearty prospector who helps him survive.  Along the way, Rudolph and Herbie find themselves on the \"Island of Misfit Toys\", an experience that encourages both of them to return home.Because every child (whether perceived or otherwise) goes through that \"ugly duckling\" stage in life, the themes in this little special are indeed timeless.  The children who watched it originally back in 1964 and the following years grew up, but never quite outgrew its classic holiday themes, passing it on to their own children until it now has become a holiday tradition.What also helps \"Rudolph\" stand apart from the rest of the holiday specials is its Claymation format.  There is probably a reason why Claymation is no longer used today in Hollywood on this sort of scale, but that rarity only enhances this show's appeal.Overall, there are three holiday media events that I try not to miss each December: \"It's A Wonderful Life\", \"Frosty the Snowman\", and this \"Rudolph\".

Believe me when I tell you, if you buy this you will need no other.There are two DVDs that include :Poultry, Meat, Vegetables, Soups, Salads, Bread, Fish, Eggs, First Courses and Dessert. To give you an example on how the DVDs and classes work:Every class has a number Example: Sauteed Chicken is 101, you watch her prepare it, if for example there is an ingredient like saut&eacute;ed mushrooms that needs to be added then that preparation is 103, you can then stop and go to 103 and see how it's prepared, that way once you know how to prepare a recipe and want to just watch the steps, you don't have to watch every single step , just what you need. And for example after saut&eacute;ed chicken come recipes that have that same chicken as the base, so once you know how to saut&eacute; chicken you can then move on to Coq au vin or chicken with mushrooms and cream or chicken provencal, etc. all with saut&eacute;ed chicken as base. And believe me with Julia preparing you feel like you can do any of those recipes. She makes you feel very confident.The DVDs also come with a booklet, and not just a crummy pamphlet but a booklet with every recipe in the DVDs.I really believe that every household should have this, it is such an easy way to come together as a family and have dinner with great food that doesn't take forever to prepare in most cases.

When it started everybody just shut up. It got interesting from the begining when Jesus starts praying in the garden and Judas betrays him. In the parts where I almost cover my eyes where on the part of the whips and chains and those things. The part where he carries the cross was one of the saddest things for me.Now we'll talk about the performances. The best performance in the movie was Caviezel's. He was the best Christ I've ever seen in movies. He looked so much like the Jesus. I think the best actor who played Christ. Then there is Mary, Jesus's mother. Did you know that the actress who played the Virgin Mary is Juish ? Her expressions were very well done. Her sadness was  incomparable. She is one of the best actress I've seen to this day. Then there is Satan. I do not know who the hell (haha) plays Satan, but she/he (I think it's a SHE) plays the part very...coldly, very...frightening. Good performance too.The movie itself was TOOOOOO violent. It's the same story, but the last twelve hours of Christ, but expressed in a very explict graphic and violent scenes. I bet you know more than two people died of watching Jesus being beat up with whips and chains and weapons. I didn't enjoy that at all. The performances were uncomparable. This movie is the most famouis R-rated movie of all times, I think you do not know that, but there are always some exceptions. It is one of the movies that you feel like you don't wanna see twice.There was also tons of strange stuff that happened during the making of the movie, I think most of you know, but for those who do not know I'll mention some of them below.When James Caviezel was crucified, I lightning stroke on his right shoulder. They had to stop the filming until he had to get better. Then, on the scenes in which he carries the cross he dislocates his shoulder (I don't remember which one it was) and they had to stop the filming for another three to six weeks. Then there was the part in the movie where Jim is taken to see some guy who looked weird that had make-up and a wig (I do not remember who that was) and when that guy spoke his lines from the script, he said other strange stuff he didn't wanna say and he had no control of it. Freaky, I know. At the part of the whipping, Jim Caviezel obviously pretended to be taken the hits, except three or four, some of those times when Caviezel was being hit with whips, they really hit him in the back a couple of times. In an interview, Caviezel explained that and he said he felt what Jesus himself felt when he was being punished. There were much more strange things that happened but I think if you buy this WIDESCREEN or FULLSCRENE edition DVD, I think if you access the SPECIAL FEATURES menu, then there should be some intervies in which Caviezel explains everythink.Buy this DVD or the FULLSCREEN formate.

Most of the work seeks the genuine passion; some of it is interpretational; but all of it is intensely passionate.  Mel Gibson didn't simply recreate the scenes well and give history its native tongue, he also presented intensity and humanness in a very real way.  If we are to believe that there was a God-man who died a cruel death on all of our behalf, then that Emmanuel was made human and divine by Jim Caveziel, better than any other actor.  We can make all we can out of our past and \"the good old days\" when America seemed more like Christendom, but theatre goers of old would not accept this suffering Jesus, so at least in our post-Christendom time, we at least accept \"The Passion\" well enough from several sectors to be able to embrace the whole package.  As a spiritual event, \"The Passion of Christ\" is unvarnished, broadening our horizons of appreciation and compunction.  As history or entertainment, it may be merely a fascinating reinactment of a horrific death penalty for a major philosophical and charismatic leader.Specifically, the focus and intensity of Judas's betrayal, Christ's Passion in the Garden, and his arrest are done with dramatic, slow-motion timing.  The extent of Jesus's suffering has been commented on truly enough, but the ordeal is certainly brought in long and vivid detail.  There is certainly a perfectionism in Gibson's rendering of each torturous moment.  If we doubt the divineness presented, then how about the love and forgiveness presented under torturous circumstances \"Look, mother, I make all things new!\"  Then, if there's incredulousness about the human traits, see similarly, the flashbacks of memory to a playful time with his mother or Caveziel shaking and looking with dread as they save their worst whips for last during the scourging.  The presentation of the devil and Judas's anguish after his betrayal are fine interpretive moments.  If you think the text is too harsh on the Pharisees, then just read the Bible.  If you think that Pontius Pilate isn't the political weasel presented or the Roman soldiers were too rough, then think again.\"The Passion of Christ\" is a courageous and authentic reinactment of the Passion and Death of Christ.

After reading up on the events of Jesus' last twelve hours as well as commentary from respected sources like Pope John Paul, I watched this film with an eye on the historical details as Mel Gibson presented them.It is true that the scenes involving the whippings and the crucifixion are extremely brutal and disturbing. But one of Gibson's purposes in making this movie was to demonstrate how Jesus suffered at the hands of the Roman guards. The newspaper critics who smugly wrote this off as if it were one more sadistic Hollywood bloodbath miss the point that anyone can produce a blood-gore-and-guts film, but very few can make it relevant in a historical perspective.Another interesting feature of The Passion is the fact that the majority of the dialogue is in Aramaic, and in the case of the Romans, Latin. I was surprised to recognize at the beginning of the film the words of one of the \"4 questions\" that we ask at the Jewish Passover meal called Seder: \"Why is this night different than all other nights?\"If there is any criticism it is that from time-to-time Gibson transitions from one scene to the next almost too quickly, and it's not always easy to keep track of who's who or what they're doing. This aside, the scenery and acting are top-notch and the story is engaging even though you know the ending.One additional item I was curious about was the charge of anti-Semitism, especially regarding the representation of the role of the Hebrew priests in Pilate's decision to crucify Jesus. Personally I think this charge was a lot of nonsense coming from people who tend to run their mouths too much. The facts are that Jesus was challenging the corrupt temple hierarchy, and the Hebrew priests' motivations were largely political, e.g., getting rid of a potential threat. During the movie I really didn't see how anyone could interpret this differently, unless you were looking for a reason to do so.The Passion of the Christ is well worth watching and I strongly recommend it.

I expected a punch in the gut- a moving,wrenching film; in short, I expected to be blown away.Well, after seeing the movie, I was neither incredibly moved, nor blown away. I just experienced an assault of never-ending violence that wasn't all that graphic, and was just pretty pointless.I understand Gibson wanted to show the world what Jesus went through, what he sacrifcied. But having Jesus whipped with a spiked barbell for 127 minutes is not the way to go about it. I WANTED to be moved, I WANTED to feel Jesus's pain and be changed or whatever by seeing all that he experienced. But I wasn't; I felt like I was being attacked by Mel Gibson who probably thought that the best way to go about it was to show Christ getting beaten, stabbed,whipped for over two hours. Instead of feeling moved-I felt numb.A few things I did appreciate was the acting-which felt very natural and didn't go over the top. What I liked the most about \"Passion\" was the fact that Gibson chose to film the whole thing in Latin with subtitles.This definately was a huge plus to the film-and it made it feel a whole lot more authentic.I can't say how much I appreciated the people behind the film going that extra mile, because it definately paid off.Is the Passion of the Christ worth seeing? I'd say, no, not really. I can't say that its a complete waste, but it really builds no common ground with the viewer-and, really, the violence is nothing to talk about. True, there is A LOT of it, but it isn't particularly graphic -I just think that its impossible to build a film, no matter what the subject involving nothing but violence,violence, and violence.So,even if you're simply going in for curiosity, there's nothing here that's going to shock or surprise you.It's a well put together film-but for such an important theme it really provides nothing to think about.p.s.-I'm Jewish, and while I can see what people mean when they say that there was a slight anti-sematic element to the film, it was a lot more slight than I expected, and I personally was not offended.I'm not a history expert-I really don't know a thing about the Bible or history, so I'm not one to discuss the film's accuracy. On a second note, I think it's kind of pointless that a person would go in to see a movie expecting a history lesson. This is one guy's personal vision-not a documentary, or a historical novel, and I'd never go into a film expecring anything of the kind. And after seeing the film, I had to laugh a bit about all the hoopla and controversy surrounding it. There's really nothing controversial about this movie(save the fact that it's about Jesus), and if the man behind the whole thing wasn't blockbuster king Mel Gibson, I doubt that anyone would've said a word about it.Overhyped, overblown- and not really a point to it.It's well put together, well acted, and for that, I give it some credit.But, that is simply not enough.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "2.5 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1086998400, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2004"}

Gyurisin \"good friend, damn fool\"", "helpful": [4, 7], "reviewText": "To start us out on the right foot, I thought that it was good, but definitely not great.  Mel Gibson is a powerful director that proves that he can handle big epics like Braveheart or very emotional stories like Passion of the Christ.  His creative eye and ability to transform a simple story into a very real and seismic journey is impressive.  There are not many directors that I feel could handle these two challenges together.  Gibson has proved that he could twice.  Throughout this film, I was constantly impressed with the visual images that were presented before me.  Everytime Jesus was hurt, I could feel the pain just oozing from the television.  The ability that Gibson has to bring us these hauntingly beautiful images and also control his actors into becoming their characters left my jaw on the ground.  He is a genuine director that was able to bring his personal passion to the screen with bold emotions and a powerful eye.As mentioned before, I felt that Gibson did a fantastic job and should have been recognized by the Academy for his ability in Passion, but the overall film seemed lacking. There I was, sitting on my couch deeply getting involved with the film, when suddenly it is over.  The last twenty minutes of this film just seemed like they were rush edited together.  I realize that it is only supposed to be an account of the final twelve hours of Christ, but I needed something sturdier to wrap the film up.  There just seemed to be so many loose ends.  Perhaps it had something to do with the random and chaotic flashback sequences that both aided and hurt the overall tone of the story.  The flashbacks were helpful in identifying the \"when\" and \"who\" of the story, but never really hit upon the \"why\".  Some flashbacks helped progress the story, while others just left me with a puzzled look on my face.  This was a negative aspect of the film.  I think the writers of this film should have just allowed the story to progress from the beginning.  Not necessarily taking up hours in building these moments, but a quick recap at the beginning would have helped the less religious person in me.  I just felt the ending and these brief snippets were distracting and not as informational as I wanted them to be (which is why they were there in the first place).Aside from that, the rest of this film was a sheer enjoyment to watch.  To see this man suffer for our sins was impressive and an act that you would not see today.  The actors in this film exceptionally portrayed the characters.  James Caviezel's emotion is unmatched in the film industry, while the nearly wordless actions of Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci added so much more to the story.  To see their eyes along could bring tears to any strong person.  The portrayal of Satan (or evil) was also impressive.  I didn't quite know how Gibson was going to incorporate this, but the method that he used provided this real image of evil instead of a \"cartoonish\" or \"CGI monster\" creation.  It kept the story balanced and provided some controversial themes for Christ as he carried the cross.  The reality of this film is what also impressed me.  Sometimes with adaptations you get these random tangents that feel like the director was just looking to pull more people into the theaters, but not with Passion.  Gibson's choice to use the language at the time was absurdly perfect.  I would have preferred to see this film without the subtitles, because it would have built a stronger emotion behind the events as they took place.  Since he did not do that, the choice to have it subtitled with still the original voice again kept this film grounded.True, this was a story about Jesus, but to me what was harder to watch was the violence that man has inside of him.  Here we have a truthful story showing man destroying man.  That to me is more frightening than all the blood on Jesus.  To watch another person do what they did to this person was simply horrific.  While others will argue that this never happened, I say to them, pick up a newspaper and read the headlines.  The actions that we do to our fellow man are just as bad as what these Romans did to Jesus.  While we may not see all the blood, our consistent lack of respect and rising murder rate prove that we care nothing for our neighbor.  This had me thinking that perhaps Gibson's true message had something to do with the status of our world today ... hum ... something to think about!Overall, I thought this was a good movie, just not the greatest I have seen.  Perhaps the excitement and publicity (good and bad) surrounding this film built it up too much, but I have seen better.  Sadly, I think the religious people in the world that speak negatively about this film need to realize that it was just a film.  There are worse movies being released today that perhaps they should be focusing their attention onto.  Gibson should have been nominated for an award for this film just because of the power that he created.  I also think that Caviezel and Morgenstern should have been rewarded for their work.  I have seen emotional films, but these two actors brought more to the table than I have seen in any other film.  It impressed me, and it should have impressed the Academy.  While I think everyone should see this film once, I do not believe it is one that should be continually recognized as one of the greats.  Gibson could have had the best film of the year, but loose ends and fragmented flashbacks caused this film to stay at average.Grade: *** out of *****", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Why is this night different from every other night?", "unixReviewTime": 1112745600, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2005"}

It interweaves high-level violence worse then you found in most horror films, the subtitling of two languages, and the brutal simplistic story of a medieval passion play. There is a single theme brought home again and again. Christ suffered for our sins.When Mel Gibson first planned making the film, he didn't want to use subtitles. Through most of the film, you don't need them anyway to understand what is taking place. There is a visual language in the stylised costumes, and the acting.Jesus Christ (James Caviezel) has a quiet distance from the world that shows without words he is the Son of God. Speaking, Caviezel detracts from this by delivering his lines with a wooden earnestness.The film occurs during the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus. It isn't easy to understand the story. Gibson may think his audience will have read the New Testament. Or he didn't want this story to detract from the violence, at the heart of the film.This violence begins when he is taken prisoner by the Jewish Temple Guards. To describe the violence he suffered here would be to detract from the graphic nature of it. Reading what happens to him, you won't be able to suspend your disbelief to believe he could have survived any of it.The scourging of Jesus is made worse by Gibson's attention to detail. The Romans have to work themselves up to be able to do it. The sound made by the torture instruments striking into Jesus' flesh. Even when Gibson shies away from the scourging, you can still hear it. This will probably become one of the most memorable, and horrifying, sequences in cinematic history.Between the scenes of Jesus' torment, we witness the other characters in the story. Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello) receives his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. But he, and his money are cursed. In scenes of graphic ugliness, he is driven to madness and suicide.The two Marys, Jesus' mother (Maia Morgenstern) and the former prostitute Mary Magdalene  (Monica Bellucci) are there to witness, and react to the suffering of Jesus. It is from them, we are meant to gauge how to feel about the events unfolding on the screen.These events are of suffering and pain. The actual crucifixion is almost a relief after the scourging. By then Jesus is a half dead, blood-splattered ruin of a man. He dies on the cross along side two common criminals. To keep the interest of his audience, here Gibson adds Hollywood touches you won't find in any bible.You also won't find any spirituality, or goodness here. The theme of this dark movie is the pain and suffering Jesus suffered on behalf of Christians. For them, it is a gorefest held in a good cause.

It is perhaps one of the most moving films ever made and one of the most important films for evangelism in today's secularist Culture of Death.Three years after its release (which, like the Gospels themselves, was a source of heated debate and division), it has been re-released as a \"Definitive Edition,\" with a number of special features:The movie is still in Aramaic and Latin, with subtitles. The purpose of this is to avoid \"bringing Jesus into today's world\" and rather force the viewer back in time, as if you were a witness to the actual events. Disc 1 has both the theatrical and re-cut version of the film, complete with accompanying commentaries by filmmakers, cinematographers, producers, musical directors and theologians. A particularly wonderful feature is an enhanced viewing mode featuring Biblical footnotes while the movie is playing. Disc 2 features one reasonably in-depth behind-the-scenes/making-of documentary. The other features on this disc include mini featurettes on religious art, ancient languages, a short showcase of the actual places in Jerusalem where the Stations of the Cross occurred, production art, a couple of deleted scenes, and a few other things like actors' bios and (disappointingly short) lives of the saints.Personally, I found the discussion regarding ancient languages most interesting. Fr.Fulco, who served as historical and ancient language consultant during the scripting, shooting and post-production of the film, is erudite and well spoken. The section on religious art was quite engaging, but a bit disappointing in its superficiality (perhaps because I have a particular interest in art history and love the details). It would have been nice, for example, if the names of artists and some details of the pieces accompanied the art documentary and the art gallery. However, in exchange, the DVD gives a great mini documentary on crucifixion as a mode of punishment and execution.As far as the behind-the-scenes features, most touching were Jim Caviezel's humble and soft-spoken interview, during which he (and others) describes the physical, mental and spiritual anguish he was made to endure during the making of this movie -- which include, but are not limited to, eight-hour makeup sessions, itching, migraine headaches, freezing weather (while in a loin cloth), being whipped for real, having the several-hundred-pound cross fall on him and crush his skull, and being struck by lightning.Over these past three years, I have often wondered (with great frustration) why they didn't include extras on the DVD release of \"The Passion of the Christ.\" Perhaps the reason was that they did not want people to view this as a regular movie, concentrating on how it was made, etc. Rather, they wanted people to take the movie as it was and concentrate on the message and the emotional/spiritual impact that it had on them, as viewers. Whether Catholic/Christian, Jewish, agnostic or atheist, it is sure to have profound impact on the very fiber of every human being.This re-release comes at a good time -- just when the movie is starting to fade from people's minds. The strong impact that it had three years ago is starting to taper out, and people are settling back into their fast-paced modern lives, which too often results in a distilling of religious convictions and a laxity of spiritual fervor.Well, Lent is around the corner (February 21, 2007), and this movie makes a wonderful accompaniment to spiritual preparation during this time.For those who have never seen the movie, now is the time.For those who have seen it, but don't particularly care to see it again -- The extras may give you a new appreciation for the film and spark a sudden desire to watch it over again. This may move you to meditate on its scenes, pray and feel closer to God.And that is a very good thing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Definitive Edition...", "unixReviewTime": 1170547200, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2007"}

The deliberate depiction of the process of His execution shows that God loves us enough to send His own Son to die a cruel death that we might be saved.

{"reviewerID": "A3NQU1649SH0Q4", "asin": "0310263662", "reviewerName": "Allen Smalling \"Eclectic Reader,\"", "helpful": [7, 11], "reviewText": ".To me Mel Gibson's stunning THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST may not be \"world class\" but is close to it, as memorable in its way as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS or AMARCORD and worthy of such enduring acceptance.Was Gibson's life-work anti-Semitic?  In my opinion, no.  Blame Herod, who is at all times righteous, unbending, fixated on Jesus' technical violations of Hebraic codes and totally hypocritical when viewed against his son's sybaritic, Romanized and decadent lifestyle -- truly a Pharisee!  But the film's plotwork:  the New Testament book of Mark, Chapters 14 through end, with flashbacks to Chapter 13, give us sufficient motivation to the Herod character by mentioning his \"envy\" of Jesus--surely that \"envy\" could only be spiritual and not material or political, except political-by-indirection?  The other two Synoptic Gospels, Matthew and Luke, enhance the motif.Also, Gibson's film portrays not so much \"the mob,\" \"the crowd,\" \"the Jews,\" or what other popular English-language bible translations have calling for Jesus' crucifixion after Barabbas' release; rather, the film clearly shows Pilate offering the option that Jesus be spared or executed after physical chastisement and Herod himself specifically calling for His crucifixion and then, the heavy majority (but NOT all) of those gathered chiming in.Perhaps the film can be gently blamed for over-sympathizing with the Romans, but the pendulum swung both ways.  The centurions and soldiers charged with whipping Jesus were clearly a sadistic lot who specialized in torture and crucifixion, ogre-like in appearance, with heavy broad noses and dark brown eyes.  (They both looked and acted subhuman.)  On the other hand, and I think Gibson is using Italian racial sub-typing to his advantage, the common soldiers whose task it was to accompany Christ to Golgotha, while keeping away the locals who wanted a piece of Him, had more clearly Piedmontese features, aquiline noses and hazel eyes.An excellent Eastern Bloc actor played Pontius Pilate and invested the character with a great deal of sympathy by means of \"close acting\" that showed the dilemma Pilate was in:  the necessity of practical politics overriding the desirability of treating Jesus in a more humane, common-sense manner (at least according to Roman  AD 30 standards).  In one of the few additions to material not found in Matthew, Mark or Luke; Lydia, Pilate's wife, brings several clean white-linen pieces of cloth to Mary and Mary Magdalene.  We, the largely Christian audience, know that these will become relics.Was THE PASSION OF CHRIST violent?  In a B-movie sense, meaning gratuitous brawling and blood-letting, no.  It was true to the text in that it portrayed the last 12 hours of Jesus' life in a graphic, literarily \"ash-can\" Naturalistic fashion, right down to the maggots crawling out of the head of a dead donkey within Judas' vision as he slumps against a tree in terror.  (Judas never has a moment's peace after he tries to return the thirty coins to Herod.)  So while THE PASSION was not violent, it was gruesome; but it was gruesome within the bounds of what the Bible tells us took place.  Perhaps nationally-syndicated film critic Roger Ebert said it best when he said that only Mel Gibson's standing within the movie industry let this film be branded an \"R\" instead of an \"NC-17.\"Should \"Mainline\" or \"Liberal\" Protestants like Methodists, Lutherans or Presbyterians see this film?  YES!  Why not, if they've a mind to?  Avoiding this film out of mere squeamishness would merely validate the stereotype that \"Establishment\" believers are a bunch of comfortable wishy-washies who are all for confronting the realities of life, death and poverty--as long as we subsidize it and someone else does the job of facing the actual ickies.I learned a lot from this film.  Personally, it was cathartic as well as riveting.  Interestingly, as with most people at the cinema, what provoked the tears was not so much the cruelty but the response along the lines of \"Do you REALIZE what you're DOING and to WHOM?\".  Because everybody killed Jesus.  And everybody is capable of killing God and killing us, too.  Roman Catholic doctrine such as the veneration of Mary and Imitatio Dei were opened up to me in ways I'd never understood before.Personally, I urge anyone with the slightest interest to see THE PASSION OF CHRIST, and not to write it off as some spiritual howler meant only as a sock to the jaw for the most hard-headed kind of R.C.'s or Evangelical Protestants in buses.

I saw it when it came out in theaters, and I own it on DVD.  As a seminary student, I wish to say a few things about this movie.  Whether or not you agree with me, that is your deal, say what you wish yourself about it.  First off, I want to say I do not like this film.  This is not a fun film.  This is not a film you would go to the Blockbuster to rent on a Friday night, to watch while eating popcorn.  This is a film about Good Friday.  This is a film about the Cross and Jesus' sacrifice.  Thus leads to the second point.  Secondly, this is a brutal film because...and if we are realistic about the Biblical narrative and the history behind the practice of torture and crucifiction by the Romans...we are talking about a truly violent event.  More than violent though, debasingly brutal in every extreme.  There was blood.  There was torn flesh.  There were cries of pain, even from Jesus' lips.  Ergo, we should not turn a blinds eye and forget the true power of what occurred that Friday two thousand years ago.  We should come to this movie in solomn understanding that what we are watching is not going to be enjoyable, but it is necessary for us to see so that we don't \"pretty\" the Gospel and skip over the drops of blood from Christ Jesus' body during those hours.  This was a sacrifice in all sense of the words, Jesus was...and is...our \"Scapegoat,\" replacing us and bearing the sins for us so that we may (through Him and only Him) come to the Father, Yahweh.  I watch this film because I have to, I need to, I need to be reminded and I need to be counseled in the ways of our Lord and Savior, the one true God, Yahweh, who shows Himself to the world as Jesus Christ.  I must be reminded and be mindful of what Jesus did that Friday along with the Sunday afterwards.  I need to be thoughtful toward the everlasting Gospel of God.  Even though I may disagree with some of the symbolism used (mostly Catholic), I still can take a lot from the film and learn.With that said, I wish to speak to those who have been belittling and accusing this film.  First and foremost, yes it is a Catholic film and there are a lot of Catholic imagery in it.  The way the movie portrays Mary is very Catholic in terms of how she acts and how she is presented.  Is this a bad thing?  Well, as a Protestant seminarian, I have to say, no not for me at any rate.  I understand what is being shown, and while I may disagree with it, I have myself no problem in holding out a hand in friendship to Catholics (i.e., I don't believe in Catholic badging like some people seem to be doing just because Mr. Gibson is a Catholic and uses Catholicism in the story narrative).  Still, you may feel that Mary the mother is given more power than she is truly given in the Bible, for as we read the Bible, and we know the Bible's truth, we see that Mary was just one woman who had given her life to Jesus by accepting the mantel of being the mother.  She is not glorified as the Catholics say she is, in the Bible if you have read your Bible, but she is shown to be a woman (just as mortal as you and I) of faith.  Secondly, I wish to say...as a supporter for such organizations as Jews for Jesus...this film in my opinion is not Anti-Semitic.  There is no Anti-Semitism in this film.  This film does not go out of its way to show the Jews as the \"bad guys\" because, if you were watching the same film I was watching, the film showed that there were Jews of all kinds at this dark day-Jews like John the Apostle, Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the Magdalene, to name a few...then again, it also shows there were wicked men who happened to be Jewish, i.e., the priests who were (if you have read your New Testament and trusted in its authority) of evil hearts toward Jesus.  What this film does is take it out of its Western European pageantry that has been so self evident in Hollywood and placed the true story of Jesus' death and resurrection back to its Jewish roots.  If you really wish to know more about the Bible, and about what the Bible says what happens, read it.  But please, don't throw demons in where there aren't any in the first place.  The film does not assault Jews.  Plain and simple.I hope that you watch this film and consider who Jesus is.  Who Jesus really is.

After all aren't Americans supposed to be tolerant of all faiths, not just their  particular view.Either way this movie scared me since it feels like a call to arms against both the Jews and the Arabs.

Never has a movie so violently assaulted my senses, affected my behavior, changed my thinking.There are many things to reflect on and talk about after seeing it, the group I was with went to a coffee place and discussed the movie for some time afterwards.  There are many symbolic things in the film, and a couple of people that night had already seen the movie twice, even though it'd only been out two days, and they commented on things they caught the second viewing that'd been missed the first time around.There is a lot of blood.  Christ's blood.  He died for the sins of the world and shed his blood for humanity.  That is the basic premise and story line.  This isn't the 'Matrix', a great film with a Christology all it's own and ton's of symbolism, this is the shocking and offensive story of what Jesus did.  Raw and offensive and ugly.  He died naked and beaten on a cross of wood.If I would have a complaint about the depiction, as horrible and brutal as it was, was that the Christ was shown with the obligatory wrapping at the waist.  In the movie 'Schindler's List' one of the great (in the sense of effecting the emotion of the viewer) scenes was when the prisoners had to line up naked and there, in shame and humiliation, await death.  I'm curious as to why full frontal male nudity was used there but not here as it would have been more faithful to the text.  However, it's a small complaint, the scenes were plenty graphic and shocking and I believe that the film followed scripture pretty faithfully with the occasional \"artistic license\" not getting too much in the way.I'm probably in the minority here, wondering why the movie wasn't even more graphic, but I'll stand my ground on that one.  If we are going to see what we did to Jesus, at least from a traditional viewpoint, we might as well take as much of the medicine as we can.  For those that don't understand the traditional Christian viewpoint of what the cross means, it means this:  Jesus hung there for you.  That's the story, whether you believe it or not or care to see it depicted or not, that's it.  That's the story that Mel Gibson, I believe, wanted to show on the screen.

It is a testament to Mel Gibson's vision, and perseverance that NO major Hollywood studio picked up this picture, which was self funded by Mr Gibson at a cost of around $30 million. The fact that the dialogue is chiefly aramaic (the movie is subtitled throughout) could also be seen as enough to discourage a lot of viewers, but there is no doubt that this is powerful film making at it's best. Perhaps \"enjoy\" is the wrong word to use in how I felt after the movie which is violent and unforgiving in showing Christ's persecution and eventual execution on the cross, but it is compelling, absorbing and emotionally charged. The success of the picture (I feel) lies in the what has been the chief subject of critisicm, the blow by blow punishment and torture the viewer cannot help but share with the main character. However, perhaps this is the strength of the movie, and I believe Gibson's aim, in showing what has always been hinted at, or happened \"off screen\" in other films of the genre.

As the theater card commercials eased into the filmed commercials into the coming attraction commercials, you felt excitement and dread slowly fill the theater. By showtime it grew to  full, a good house for a night dominated for years by \"must see TV.\" Murmuring, chomping, bustling, and normal theater activity halted literally from the first scene where, without a title credit, you are placed in the garden as Jesus weeps and prays before His arrest and trial, challenged and victorious over an androgynous devil figure.In the two hours that follow director Mel Gibson, and his stars including Jim Cavieziel as Jesus and Maia Morganstern as His mother Mary, create what can only be considered a religious horror film. They use all trademarks of that genre: slow motion recreations of gore and brutality, tangible depictions and battles between good and evil (including demonic chase and possession), classically-based cinematography and a brooding John Debney musical score. All this in as historically accurate and visually beautiful a setting as such a film could take place. This is not the horror fantasy of Freddy Krueger slashing nubile teens, pointing to his glove and snarling, \"This...is God.\" The verbal taunts and physical punishment lie on Jesus, the Saving Victim Christians see as God made man.No one will leave this film unmoved. I and many around me cried seeing a bludgeoned Jesus comforted by (and comforting) His Mother; their scenes on Jesus' walk to Calvary and at His Crucifixion are as simple and heartfelt as the beatings are excruciating. Gibson uses his considerable cinematic skill to slow down and intensify, rather than deflect, violence Christ suffers.His blood, which Christians believe washed sin away, dominates this film. It splatters on His torturers, oozes through the nails on His Cross, spurts from His side a Roman soldier pierces kneeling before Jesus' Cross. (You wish Gibson would have allowed one of those centurions the line, \"Truly this was the Son of God.\") This film validates someone fully man as well as fully God suffered for our sins, and felt this unbearable pain doing so. (This, however, does not justify a rather sickening scene at the Crucifixion involving a crow which represents the film's most unnecessary violence and which even those supporting the film would decry.)No one will leave this film unblamed for Jesus' death. It is no more Sanhedrin determination, nor Pontius Pilate's indecision nor his soldiers' sadism nor Herod's drunken curiosity (the scenes between Jesus and Herod get as close to comic relief as \"The Passion\" allows, and it's not that close) which seals Jesus' fate. Through flashbacks of Jesus' ministry Gibson shows they - and we - are responsible for the suffering Jesus came to endure. (To that end, you wonder if Gibson could not have included a flashback to Jesus' rebuking Peter - \"Get thee behind me, you Satan!\" -  after hearing Jesus announce His death and resurrection.)The showing I attended saw many people leave the screening, waiting in the lobby from the intensity of what they saw and felt. The audience left afterward stunned silent, the only film I'd seen to prompt such reaction. (Gibson shows the Resurrection, earth's happiest day on which Christian faith is built, as a determined moment of mission rather than of celebration, complete with martial music.)No one can leave this film ambivalent about Jesus or His mission. Watching it, seeing his pain and vicariously enduring it, you must either accept Him as Messiah or dismiss Him as a madman. \"The Passion\" was made by dedicated, committed people and will demand the same of anyone, curious to brave enough,  choosing to view it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the Most Emotionally Moving Films Ever Made", "unixReviewTime": 1078099200, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2004"}

Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.\"The Passion of the Christ\" has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema.

If Jim Caviezel did so awesome a job portraying Jesus, one can only imagine the Lord's expression when the events in this film actually happened a couple millennia ago.Based on the Gospels and Roman and Jewish history, Mel Gibson has crafted a well-executed account on what Jesus Christ went through on our behalf.Many complain the film is nothing but sheer gore. Yes, it is bloody, but if you look into Roman history and discovered what Roman scourging and crucifixion entailed, you'd find Gibson's film is bang on. He also made the right choice to display what happened how it happened instead of just putting a few scratch marks on Jesus and a robe splashed with red paint like other films have done. By seeing Jesus murdered as He was, the audience feels the impact of that day long ago. It forces them to pause and reflect.This film serves as a reminder for believers in Jesus, and serves, hopefully, as a touching account of the ultimate sacrifice from the ultimate Love to those who don't believe.It would take a terribly cold heart to not be moved by this film.Very recommended.A.P.

I have yet to hear anyone on the contrary say that they have found evidence or proof that the torture Jesus endured was a walk through the park. Also, I'm sure there is some jealousy and resentment amongst the powerful film studio moguls(including those who did not want to touch or back up Gibson's project) who only wished they would have had half the vision and [guts] Mel Gibson possessed in directing The Passion of the Christ! Hats off to Gibson and the casting director for utilizing the gifted talents of international actors and not Hollywood's popular elite. Some may think Mel is \"wacko\" but after all there is a method to his madness or madness to his method that yields brilliant works such as Braveheart and now The Passion of the Christ...The passion for Gisbon's directing and vision surely comes through !Now, the film itself is a masterpiece in technical terms of cinematography, acting, costume and set design, special effects and soundtrack...Regardless if the dialogue was Aramaic or Latin, the subtitles did not hinder at all the action or watching the actors on screen. Nor do they deter the understanding of the story. The imagery varies from simply rich, panoramic, to haunting and nightmarish (involving scenes of the devil or his minions)! The artistic and skillful use of flashbacks to coincide with pivotal scenes (though every scene is practically pivotal) cannot be forgotten. One flashback involving Jesus as a beautiful and angelic curly headed toddler and a young Virgin Mother running to comfort him from a fall will put a knot in anyone's throat.It is one of the most emotional flashbacks regardless if one is a parent or not... The image is strong and will stay in the mind for time to come.I did not view this film in the hopes of being \"entertained\" in the regular or superficial sense of the word. I went to be further \"educated\". I was.Way beyond what I had expected. If you have not seen this film, forget any controversy or preconceived notions.Take any controversy, negative reviews out of the equation, and even forget Mel Gibson directed this for just 2 hours and see the film as it stands on its own...If you can walk away from this film extracting something positive and taken to heart from the viewing experience, and it is an experience(whether spiritual, educational, or other ways) then count yourself amongst the enlightened ones and not those who have become outraged or bittered.

In America and the world today, the divide between those who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ and those who haven't has never been clearer. To believers, The Passion is a painful but ultimately moving depiction of the suffering, death and resurrection of their Savior. To non-believers, it is a violent portrayal of a mythical event.The film itself is well made. As remarked previously, the subtitles are not distracting in the least. Most viewers are familiar enough with the story to figure out who Mary is and who Pontius Pilate is. The cinematography is beautiful in most places and the film doesn't drag on. Theologically, I found the film utterly lacking in anti-Semitism and a bit overly Catholic (esp. in relation to Mary), but Gibson is a devout Catholic and this was his dime, so I was able to move past that. The extra-Biblical material did not detract significantly from the Gospel accounts to the point of concern.That leads to the much discussed and maligned violence of the film.It makes sense that the New Testament goes into little detail regarding the actual crucifixion and scourging. No one of that time needed a description as they likely had seen it first hand on many occasions. The reader of that time knew all too well the horrors inflicted by scourging and the agonizing death on a cross. To the genteel viewers of today, accustomed to stylized violence and gore being fed to them via CGI, it WAS absolutely necessary to show the up close and personal violence, inflicted by one person upon another, to really understand the pain that Christ suffered on our behalf. I doubt I will watch this DVD over and over again, but I certainly think that it bears watching again and I will buy it just to spite those who blindly opposed it without ever seeing the movie.I laugh ruefully at those reviewers who sadly try to make light of the Passion with crude humor. Not because they are funny, but because it is so typical of those who do not believe. I don't find it offensive, but I am afraid God will. He will not be mocked, which I suspect will be discovered to the chagrin of the mockers someday.

It's remarkable that so many evangelicals have expressed support for it. But then, many evangelicals and similar groups co-operate with the Moonie Jonathan Wells. So perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised by their opportunism towards Gibson?The traditionalist Catholic slant of \"The Passion of the Christ\" is obvious in many ways. Some of the situations depicted in the movie aren't found in the Gospels, but in the visions of a Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich. Others seem to be Gibson's own invention, but they are consistent with Catholic tradition, as when Satan mocks the Madonna and the Child. The whole concentration on the violent suffering of Jesus also looks very Catholic. So is the use of the Latin language. Jesus speaks to Pontius Pilate in Latin, although Greek would have been more likely. While Pilate was a Roman, the lingua franca of the East Mediterranean was Greek. There is no indication in the Gospels that Jesus used an interpreter when speaking to Pilate, which suggests that the Gospel writers assumed their conversation to be in Greek (which is also the language of the Gospels themselves.) So why the use of the Latin language? Presumably because Latin is the traditional liturgical language of the Catholic Church. Indeed, much of the conflict between traditionalist Catholics and Vatican II Catholics has been over the use of the traditional Latin mass. I also noticed that the Latin spoken by Pilate and Jesus in the Gibson's movie sounds like Italian! Apparently, ecclesiastical Latin does have an \"Italian\" pronunciation.But the most contentious issue concerning the movie is, of course, the real or perceived anti-Semitism. The Jews of the Sanhedrin certainly look like anti-Semitic stereotypes. Herod Antipas is depicted as an effeminate gay. Also, Pilate is cast in the role of unwilling executioner, as in the Gospel of John, the most anti-Jewish of the four gospels. Of course, it's difficult to make a \"pro-Jewish\" traditional Christian movie about Jesus. Traditional Christianity isn't pro-Jewish, anymore than Orthodox Judaism is pro-Christian. However, Gibson should at least have excised the more blatant stereotypes. That Gibson later made anti-Semitic remarks during the infamous DUI incident, hardly helped his case, despite his public apologies to the Jewish communities.\"The Passion of the Christ\" is an artistic achievement as a movie, but due to its problematic contents, I can only give it two stars.

I know the Stations of the Cross as well as anyone who grew up Catholic, and I know the Gospels as well any Baptist. However, like Chicago Sun-Times movie critic Roger Ebert, I was connected with the reality of the suffering Christ went through in a very real way. It is just a movie, and the guy on the cross wasn't Jesus. But it caused me to think about Jesus in a whole new way.I knew this was coming. I have read dozens of articles on this and tuned into every show on the movie. Not good enough. It still hit me. It wasn't the blood that spattered on my face, but the love that spattered on my heart. I sat in that theater as a Christian who believes, but I experienced something very heavy that evening. There is no separating my Christian beliefs from my reaction to the movie.The subtitles take nothing from the experience, and add to the focus on the movie's story rather its dialogue.The beginning sets the dramatic tone, delivering us into the Garden of Gesthemene as Jesus prays. Judas kisses him softly on the cheek, and a fight ensues between the posse of soldiers and Jesus' disciples. Jesus himself waits, and even heals the ear wounded by Peter, whom Jesus rebukes. The following events include a trial and flogging. Jesus never raises a hand or comment against his accusers, nor does he deny their accusations that he claims to be God. Pilate is torn politically, wanting to do the right thing and wanting to save his own position. Unwilling to assert a position, he lays the call onto the town's citizen who are in a blood-frenzy.What grabbed me in the movie were unexpected scenes, like Jesus and Mary connecting sight on the Via Dolorosa. Jesus stumbles, and the movie flashes back to Mary running to a four year old Jesus who stumbled in a field. She picks him up, holds him motherly. Now, Jesus is 33, all battered and worn from a vicious, sadistic abuse by Roman soldiers. Mary runs to him. He speaks to her, whispering cryptically, \"See mother, I make all things new,\" and does his best to press on. It is his cross to carry, and he raises to his feet.The ending is ingeniously subtle. In some ways, they are the 30 most important seconds of the movie in which it all comes together. Every drop of blood, every rejected silver piece, and every cross-dragged furrow in the road to Golgotha comes together in probably the most understated yet complete climax to a movie I have ever seen.I understand now why people bought tickets for friends, dragged people to see it. I expected to be blown away, but I didn't expect to be hit at my core on so many different levels.The movie isn't perfect. Some scenes took more poetic license than can be historically supported. Herod was decadently different than I expected, and perhaps the least like the real Herod. Herod's lascivious persona here matches the essence, if not the exact personality. His reactions to the Christ situation were consistent with the Bible, and add texture to Pilate's dilemma.Some vague scenes confused me, like when Satan carries a grimacing, sneering man-child. However, as Satan's gender is not important to his evil nature, the androgyny holds up.A knowledge of Christian scripture will augment an understanding of the film's secondary flashback scenes. The movie does stand on its own, and meets the vision of its controversial director. Whether the audience is a devout believer, or seeing the movie as an artistic portrayal of history's most influential figure, the movie will work. I expect it to be rerun in theaters every Easter season.I fully recommend this movie.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cataclysmic, Profound Movie Bigger Than Controversy", "unixReviewTime": 1078704000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2004"}

Been quite a long time since I've written a review for Amazon.com, and finally I've written something that will rock with your head and eat your soul like my others.  Here's a review I've put off writing for quite awhile because I really wanted to wait for the hype to die down.  And after reading so many different viewpoints on this website and others, it's caused quite a stir indeed.  Well, here we go.The film largely follows that of the catholic faith's \"Stations of the Cross\" and while I'm not too entirely familiar with it, I know that it details the \"passion\" (literally meaning \"suffering\") of Jesus Christ and finally being nailed on the cross.  Mel Gibson himself is catholic and had this idea incubating in his head for years and I'll tell you what, this film really got to me.  It's wondrous cinematography (remember the film The Black Stallion?  Same guy!), authentic languages of Aramaic and Latin (which by the way, Aramaic was used by the common people, Latin by the Romans.  Just thought you'd find that interesting.), and the wonderful performances by everyone involved, especially Jim Caviezel as Jesus.  I previously saw him in \"Frequency\" and already knew he was a good actor, but this movie proved that he is indeed a GREAT actor.  Monica Bellucci, who played in the Matrix films and played a whore in that stupid \"Brotherhood of the Wolf\" film, is Mary Magdalene here and also turns in a fine performance here.Gibson actually did some nice artistic touches here, especially with the flashbacks.  I think this is where some Christians get pissed off because he took a few liberties.  Example: in the Bible when Jesus is tempted in the Garden of Gethsemane, we see Satan (presumably) tempting him to not fulfill the prophecy.  While the Bible never outright says it is Satan, I found it very plausible.  Satan is regarded as the evil spirit, or the fallen angel, who tempts us through sin.  It would seem very likely to me that Satan wouldn't want Jesus to die for us.  Gibson also used the \"original sin\" idea, showing Satan with the ugly baby, and also with Judas being shameful and eventually killing himself for what he had done.My only complaint with this is I wanted to see a little more to the resurrection than we saw.  I wanted to see everyone's faces when they would see Jesus alive and well.  Oh well, I guess.  After all, no matter how well you make a religious film, it can't be perfect (and plus, that wasn't really the focus of this film).So why did it affect me like it did?  Well, I may be the strong religious person that I am (and loves heavy metal, how about that?), but in growing up in the Protestant faith, I never really concentrated on Jesus' suffering; after all, without the resurrection, it would've been a moot point.  However, when watching the film, all I could really think of was \"He did THAT for me?\"  I never really thought about what he went through, and this film changed my thinking forever.  I'm not sure if I would outright tell you to see this movie because it's very graphic and poignant; however, if you do, I HIGHLY suggest you watch it with an open mind because I've known people to hate it just because of their opinions on what the Bible is and so forth.  If you don't like the film because of its graphic nature, then you are well in your right.  If you don't like it based on your preconceptions of what Jesus went through or it disagrees with your religious opinion (for example, I have a friend who didn't like it just because he thought Jesus was totally human and not spiritually the \"Son of God\" and therefore could not live during the crucifixion.), then that is simply your opinion but I still can't help but feel like you are allowing those preconceptions to override the fact that this is indeed just a film, and the filmmaker is showing his deepest love for Christ.It's not a film for everybody to enjoy and even I find it hard to enjoy as entertainment.  But it quite possibly might have been the most influential film I've ever seen in my life.  While my faith first and foremost comes from the Scriptures, this film still makes a profound impact for me and you have to respect Mel Gibson for doing what he did.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quite possibly the most moving religious film of our time.", "unixReviewTime": 1102032000, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2004"}

{"reviewerID": "AHKOPVTQ3IEBL", "asin": "0310263662", "reviewerName": "Baltic Books \"Vic\"", "helpful": [9, 12], "reviewText": "See the movie!  Buy the DVD.Okay everyone.  We finally went to see the controversial Mel Gibson portrayal of the last day of Jesus life (the events of that day are commonly called \"The Passion\").Here are some of my thoughts:* Not nearly as violent as Saving Private Ryan, or any number of other movies featuring cinematic \"realism\" today.  Having said that, there is no way around it, this is a violent film, but I don't think an NC-17 is justified in this case as suggested by some film critics.The thing is, for hundreds of years the death of Christ as occurring in a crucifixion has been so sterilized that people (I'm talking to Christians mostly) attribute a kind of Santa Claus or Easter Bunny mythology to what Jesus went through.  This portrays the crucifixion accurately from a realistic standpoint verified by the Journal of the American Medical Association. (The Journal of the American Medical Association, March 21, 1986, Volume 256).* Accurate to the biographical record written by two eye witnesses to Jesus-- Matthew and John; and one historian-- Luke, and the record probably dictated to Mark by Peter.  The film is based on these historical records, commonly called the Gospels. From my viewpoint as a guy with a degree in Bible and Theology, they closely follow the events.Obviously there is some cinematic license taken to make an interesting screenplay, but even in those moments I felt the film was true to the spirit of the records.* Anti-Semitic?  I don't think so. There were several criticisms leveled against the film.  One was that Jews were always shown in a poor light.  That is not true. While the key leaders that brought Jesus to trial were accusing him and probably inciting their people in order to get a death sentence, it is accurate to the biographical record.Having said that, it is most important to note: Outside of the Roman occupiers of Jerusalem, every person portrayed was a Jew.  At no time did Jesus or any of his followers call for any kind of judgment against the Jewish leadership.  Plus, at least two of the Jewish leaders were clearly shown to support Jesus.  Additionally, Jesus was a Jew, as was his mother, all his followers and every person supporting and sympathizing with him.Following the crucifixion the Bible clearly shows his followers stayed active in the local Jerusalem temple. (cf: Acts 2; Acts 3). They remained Jewish, and actively maintained their temple worship for at least several years. To say the film is anti-Semite is to say it calls judgment on Jesus followers.* \"His blood be on us and our children\" is a famous line in the gospels and critics cry out that this line alone is enough to incite violence against Jews. However it does not appear in the current film version (unless it is an untranslated line in Aramaic or Hebrew).  This line is one of the great and beautiful ironies of the gospels. Matthew 27:24-26 presents these words as the crowd calls for Jesus crucifixion. The irony is while it seems that people-leaders are reckless calling a curse or judgment on themselves for Jesus death, the truth is that is exactly what allows all people to enjoy the extended forgiveness and favor with God. The Bible clearly teaches it is Jesus blood that is the means to forgiveness.  The blood is the vehicle of mercy, not judgment.* Jon Voight incorrectly cites film techniques employed by Nazi's in the 1930s.  Actor and director, Jon Voight this week on CNBC and MSNBC implied that Gibson used techniques designed to vilify Jews. He stated frames of Jews were interspersed with frames of demonic figures, suggesting these are a means to demonify Jews.Voight needs to see the film again and take another look.  The instances where this took place were as Judas was in the process of his betrayal subsequently overwrought with the guilt of his actions.  He was clearly demonized (rightly so) and some images were clearly hallucinated. In another scene you see a demonic figure with the satan-character.  You never one time see a demonic figure linked to any Jewish leader or person of any prominence.* You should read the biographies (gospels) of Jesus life before seeing this film-- or certainly after you see it. The film can stand for itself as a piece of cinematic art, however it assumes you are very familiar with the history of Jesus life, and hopefully the prophetic Jewish writings of the Old Testament that are a setting for the coming of a \"Messiah\" that would save all people from sins. Each biography presents the life of Jesus from a different viewpoint. However, if you do not have any background in the Bible, you might want to read a \"synoptic\" version--one that has incorporated all four biographies into one chronological record also called a \"harmony of the gospels\".A free copy of one of these is available online called the \"Book of Hope\".

It is superbly shot, the cinematography literally breath-taking in its intensity and ability to add muscular heft to the familiar story of how Jesus came to fulfill the prophecy through his divine sacrifice on behalf of all mankind. The movie-goer is sure to be transformed by the magnitude of the oft-told and retold tale of how the events of the final twelve hours focused on the ways in which Jesus deliberately serves himself up as the sacrificial lamb for the manifest sins of the world, offering all humans the opportunity to re-establish their contact with the divine from whom they had been estranged.Indeed, I found myself almost speechless after viewing the film, and was not quite sure to what extent it was a result of the power of the film's message as opposed to the graphically violent context in which the tale is told. Herein lies the single criticism one can level against the film, which despite many worries from bystanders that it was laced with virulent anti-Semitism, seems to clearly blame all sinners (ergo, all of us) for the sacrifice of God's son on the cross. Yet Mel Gibson's sure hand is both able and accurate, and the violence shows how carnal man greets the divine, and how we react to the message of hope and salvation; through unspeakable cruelty and gratuitous violence. So, while this is indeed a very violent movie, the murderous acts depicted quite graphically have to be taken in the context of the supernatural events transpiring, as a kind of carnal counterpoint to the ethereal repose with which Jesus bears all of the acts visited upon him. At one point He tells Mary (After he has stumbled under the burden of the cross) &quot;Behold, mother, I make all thing anew!\" This was, for me at least, a quite stunning reminder of the godly forces at work amidst all the violence and carnage.This is a very personal interpretation of the final twelve hours of Christ's life on earth leading to His crucifixition. From the moment it opens in the solitude of the Garden at Gethsemane, one is immediately aware of the battle ongoing between good and evil, as the devil (cleverly presented as a stunning if malevolent woman with a masculine voice) attempts to dissuade Jesus from attempting what he about to undertake. From this it is obvious He is doing this for all mankind, Jews and Gentiles alike, and that we are all to blame, through our unremitting addiction to carnality and sinfulness, for the evil manifested in the world. This is a fantastic film, one that is definitely not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, and definitely not something I would suggest subjecting a child to.

On the one hand there are the faithful believers who rever him as the Son Of God & people who think he was merely a man who the Bible and the Church made a diety of in order to scare people into embracing their beliefs with half-witted \"prophecies\" of hellfire & brimstone.THE PASSION OF CHRIST is the third feature to be Directed by Mel Gibson, in fact the film was a sheer labor of love for him as he also co-produced & co-wrote the film (which is in Gaelic & Aramaic with English subtitles).THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST focuses on Jesus's last hours on Earth, from the Garden Of Gethsemane, the Last Supper, Christ's betrayal by Judas, Peter's denial of him through to extensive scenes of his trial for blasphemy and crucifixion (which makes up a good portion of the film). Jim Cavizel (billed as James here), best known for his roles in movies such as FREQUENCY & THE THIN RED LINE gives the performance of his career as Jesus. There's only one problem; and for me this really blunted the full impact of the film somewhat: for two hours I saw Jim Caviezel, the actor; PLAYING Jesus Christ.Depending on your beliefs you will either love or despise this movie. I thought it was good but I found it kind of sick how people can only enter heaven by worshipping Christ, \"God's Only Son\". I found it especially interesting after reading Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\" last year, and seeing that the book HUMANISED Jesus. Interestingly, it's alleged the church covered up evidence Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a daughter named Sarah. Apparently the myth of Magdalene being a prostitute may have been the result of a smear campaign by the Catholic Church; and that in actuality Christ had blood descendants. Not a good image for the Son Of God, is it? But wait, when I was a Catholic as a child I was told we were ALL God's children! How about some common sense? How about THE TRUTH!In all fairness, I actually quite liked the movie. There are good performances, the film is beautifully shot and also THE PASSION OF CHRIST is truly a ground breaking film. I think this may be the first Christian exploitation movie! And boy, is it bloody! This is the first film to show the crucifixion as the disgusting spectacle it was. We see Jesus be bloodily whipped with barbs & having a crown of thorns nailed to his head (after Pilate spares a raving lunatic from crucifixion in favor of Christ, which I considered rather odd), Christ being forced to carry his cross up the Mount, falling several times along the way, being aided by Simon Of Cyrene and having blood cleaned from his face by Veronica. It's all very vividly created but all the film did was further reinforce my reasons for lapsing from the Catholic faith. What God would do this to his own son? Not MY idea of God. My God has a sense of humor (In fact there IS a scene here where Jesus displays humor when he is making a table & talking to his mother. Where's the humor in the Bible?)Also, I could not write this review without pointing out one of the biggest ironies in the history of NZ's censorship laws I have EVER come across. SPCS, the people who are still trying to ban BAISE MOI & VISITOR Q (Their motto should be \"If at first you don't succeed: Fail, Fail & Fail again\") are lobbying to have the films R16 rating in NZ LOWERED so 13-15 year olds can see it with a parent! Because this is JESUS! The violence is JUSTIFIED! Not only that; but how can that classification be ENFORCED? It's beyond a joke & especially ironic considering this co-stars Monica Bellucci of IRREVERSIBLE! (NZ seems to be the only country in the western world where IRREVERSIBLE is not getting a DVD release! So I legally can't buy it! I love NZ).So I'll finish off my review with a question: Why is it supposedly OK according to SPCS for kids to see this (Personally I think the movie would give them nightmares) but, as I've said before adults can't watch what they choose of their own free will? A classic example of the pot calling the kettle black, if you ask me.How much you enjoy (\"enjoy\" being a loose term here given the movie's gruesome subject matter) THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST boils down to your personal belief system, and will be interpreted and discussed in countless different ways. In a nutshell though, three star review aside; this really is a movie you should see for yourself, regardless of your religious beliefs: Christian, Jew, Muslim, atheist, agnostic it doesn't matter.

The acting is quite good and as a history freak I found it interesting to hear Latin and Aramaic. I did not find it anti-semitic, but then I can understand why Jewish folk might be suspicious, given the beliefs espoused by Gibsons' family, and never actually disavowed by Gibson himself.I am not a Christian, so it struck me as odd that Christians would like this film from a theological standpoint. Perhaps I am just not getting it. I always understood that the most central point of the Jesus story was that he arose from the dead, not that he was tortured to death. So it suprises me that the film would concentrate almost entirely on this one aspect of the story, rather than on the resurrection part. That it does not, smacks of violence-as-a-marketing-tool to me. When all the hoopla has died down, it will be interesting to see how much money Gibson will have made off of the suffering of his savior.I have to say that I am more than a little shocked at the fawning tone I have seen in these reviews, particularly from Christians. The enthusiastic way in which they are taking joy in watching someone being slowly tortured to death is sickening; and exactly the same sort of bloodthirsty eagerness that the ancient Romans displayed when they watched animals and people (including Christians) being executed in the arena. The fact that there is a religious purpose to the film does not excuse this. I wonder if this movie were made with the exact same types of scenes, but without the religious content, how many of reviewers would still sing its praises.

Shame on all of you.If you don't think about the movie's religious implcations and view it as a horror flick in period costume, the movie comes off just fine.

I would think after seeing this movie people would be even more skeptical of the events that supposedly took place at that point in history because I already was a skeptic and now this whole Jesus phenomena is all the more laughable. Mel is a sick individual and he just made millions tugging at the heart strings of all of these \"Christians\" and is about to make millions more because these \"Christians\" will probably gobble this movie up and use it as a \"teaching\" tool for all of the future brainwashees in all of the churches across the country.

I don't care what your minister says, allowing anyone under thirteen years of age to see this film is WRONG.  It's an incredibly brutal and violent film and there are many alternatives if you want young people to see a movie about the crucifixion of Christ.  I know that kids these days get exposed to lots of violent movies, TV shows and video games, but if you're even thinking of letting your child see this watch it first by yourself, then decide.Now that I have that over with, on with the review of the DVD.  Mel Gibson made a technically brilliant film, from the costumes, sets, languages and the like, but he didn't take a great deal of risks with this movie.  The film is beautifully shot, but the characters take a back seat to the unrelenting violence.  The depiction of Satan is particularly one dimensional, with virtually no interaction with Jesus except for a brief exchange relatively early in the film.  The rest of the time, the devil skulks around looking very creepy and sinister, but ultimately comes off as a spooky but ineffectual piece of background.A comparison begs to be made to \"The Last Temptation of Christ\".  In that movie, Satan tempts Jesus by showing him just what he's giving up by allowing himself to be crucified for the sins of humanity - the love of a woman, a family, in essence giving up the chance at a normal life.  You realize the gravity and scope of that sacrifice and are compelled to admire the choice he made.In contrast, all you get with Gibson's film is a portrayal of the betrayal and subsequent slow, brutal murder of a human being.  The relatively accurate glimpse of life two thousand years ago is a bonus, but I feel that Mel could've made this much more than it ended up being.  It shocked me, but it didn't go much deeper than that.Considering the subject of the film, that's pretty sad.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A potentially powerful movie reduced to a splatter film...", "unixReviewTime": 1094256000, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2004"}

The fact is, unlike Gibson's previous two major historical outings (Braveheart & The Patriot) this movie is about 80 % historical sources (in this case the broad outline of Matthew and other synoptics, with dialogue therefrom), 20 % the director.  The other 2 movies had a less than 50% historicism & were well over 50% personally interpretive -- and at very critical points.  In my view these last two directorial attempts by Gibson were flawed for such reasons -- given very questionable historical interpretations in both.  These were the trepidations I had before viewing this movie, rather than the rest of the unbelievable hoopla.The fact is, lacking either Roman or Jewish sources for Christ's passion (although both the Roman Tacitus and the Jewish Talmud admit Christ was actually put to death during Pilate's tenure) there is no detailed historical source other than the gospels for this story, like it or not.  Coldly viewed, the film is thus no different than several other films which more or less rigorously follow some pre-existing text -- putting aside the question whether the text is fact or fiction, ie. Kubrick's Barry Lyndon ( historical novel), Fellini's Satyricon (ancient book that may or may not be historically based), The Bounty (mixed fact and fiction). It is virtually impossible to imagine a filmic treatment of any text that does not have at least a 10 to 15% dose of interpretation from the maker. So the criticism that has followed  is necessarily not based on the Gibson interpretation, but against the gospel itself.  The argument, necessarily then, must be that the gospel should no longer be represented filmically, for some reason.  This is a political question, since such censorship could only be enforced by political means.  Despite many expressed fears, such a result -- outright censorship -- is hardly likely in the United States, now or in the forseeable future.In brief, if didacticism is properly understood as the artist's overlay of personal vision and interpretation -- and not what the artist's personal creed (religious or political) happens to be -- the film is much less didactic than Gibson's other ventures into historical presentation, and for that matter much less didactic than the vast majority of other film.  The current criticism, again, necessarily is with Gibson's own doctrine; rationally speaking it could not be with the fact he has one (since any honest person will admit that every adult has some sort of a belief system in the broad sense of the word).The historicism of Passion is visually obvious to any rational viewer, believer or unbeliever.  To a disinterested viewer, ie., one without any particular religious axe to grind, the movie resembles nothing so much as an attempt to portray the confusion and cruelty of the ancient world in a highly realistic and authentic manner.  Why this should not be a valid enterprise for an American realist would be hard for critics to say; they avoid the issue.  Research on the institution of Roman crucifixion and scourging demonstrates that this sort of scholarship much more informs the making of Passion than, say, Gibson's use of the Catholic mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich, which while it has been much vaunted is really only window dressing here.  The long and short of it is that the scourging (the truly new element in this passion film presentation, never previously so fully rendered in other films about Christ) is highly informed realism consistent with scholarship and with the reason for this scourging, in Christ's case.  See  Zugibe, \"Forensic and Clinical Knowledge of the Practice of Crucifixion\" (Turin 2000); Zaninotto, \"The Shroud and Roman Crucifixion:  A Historical Overview\" (Turin 2000).The realism and subtlety of the portrayal of Roman leaders and the Roman system in this film far outdistances the best of similar recent ventures, ie. Gladiator.  It matches the highest standard I know of in this area, Kubrick's Spartacus.  I doubt Gibson's Pilate will ever be improved upon; it is worth the price of admission.  You may like this or that disciple in the film more, but take a close look at Pilate if you can stand it; this guy is really us.I would also frankly admit that the Jewish authority figures are not presented with the same subtlety.  It would be a better film if they had been.  But their milieu in this film is not presented as malicious in any sense, rather highly confused (which Pilate points out).  In any event the figure who is quite obviously the hero of the film, in the full classical sense, Jesus, not only reinforces Pilate's verdict on their behavior -- \"they know not what they do\" -- but also explicitly forgives them.  A person attempting to pin an anti-Semetic didacticism onto this film therefore ignores the most pointed statements on the subject by the story's focus and hero -- a most dubious venture.  Of course, it is well known that the anti-Passion  campaign has only been successful by innuendo, guilt by association (Gibson's father), and other tactics unworthy of serious discourse.If one is reduced to keeping count of such things as an indicator, the subtlety of the psychological realism of the characters portrayed, and their corresponding sympathy, switches polarity at the street level (unlike Caiphas, most ordinary Jews at street level are remarkably \"round,\" in E. M. Forster's sense, as compared to the rank and file Romans who, unlike Pilate, are somewhat cartoonish).  Such an effect is not possible, of course, if the director or text is anti-Semetic.  Before using such terms regarding film, one ought to know the real thing by having viewed a couple \"educational\" films from Nazi Germany about the science of eugenics.  In any event, true racism is objectively presented in the movie -- of certain Romans against Jews.Beyond the authentic/realistic context, our hypothetical viewer without a particular credal axe to grind, knowing nothing of the new testament (like a man from Mars) would most likely just legitimately wonder -- why are they doing this to this man?  The film's explanation (based on Matthew) is Jesus' apparent claim to be part of a deity, by a certain formula of words.  Focusing on the passion, the film does not fully explain this -- the man from Mars would basically come away with an impression of some sort of great taboo that was broken, causing frenzy and confusion among the Jewish authorities.  But again, malice would not be the conclusion.  Indeed Caiphas is portrayed as not wanting to kill Christ before the taboo words are spoken.  An objective atheist or our man from Mars could not then come away holding that any sort of assumed racial defect or malignancy was the cause.  If anything, it is the sheer power of the taboo that is the cause.  A true atheist or confident rationalist would not fear this critical focus of the movie, then, since he would reject the taboo ipso facto as a religious belief system.  Indeed he might well yet be interested in the film, very interested in it indeed, as a modern attempt to authentically portray the consequences of breaking a powerful taboo in the ancient world.The fact is, I have heard no criticism based on the fact that the movie justifies the breaking of the taboo against saying \"I am.\"  Yet a truly principled attack on the movie would not only have to start there, but grapple with that centrally, and then say something in favor of continuing that taboo in conclusion, ie, censorship of texts or artworks that include that verbal formula.  Of course, none of us have heard such a thing.Regarding the use of Anne Catherine Emmerich, the Marian and/or \"stations of the cross\" images, etc.:  this is nothing more than Gibson's signature, the 20% quotient of interpretivism.  It is mainly visual, and neither adds nor subtracts any major element not in the source, Matthew.  It is a question of emphasis.  And it serves to give artistic unity to the whole.  Yes, it does also admit that Gibson is a believer -- such an unambiguous admission to the audience actually being an honest, and therefore praiseworthy virtue, even from the perspective of an ethical pagan.  Only certain modern pagans, cut loose from Aristotle, Homer, and the roots of Western culture, advocate the creation of subversive artwork that fools or tricks its audience into beliefs or attitudes cleverly disquised or contra-indicated.  While a prime tool of Marxists, such tactics were considered unworthy in the ancient world and indeed there are no known texts from that world which employ such a strategy.Actually, the real subject of this movie is conversion.  Gibson conveys Christ's gaze as the operative machine of this process, with some analogy  to the fine use of Christ's shadow by director Nicholas Ray in King of Kings (1961).  Comparing and contrasting to this and other filmic precedents would be more interesting than much of what we have been hearing, not only from foes but also from some purported friends of Passion.I have been trying to write this in a manner to avoid taking a lot away from a fresh first viewing, which I certainly urge.  But I cannot help adding one last comparison -- of the Simon scene to John Paul II's poem, \"Portait of a Cyrenean\" a/k/a \"Simon of Cyrene.\"  One cannot claim that Gibson read the late pope's poem, but the visual parallels are remarkable.Actually, your best prep for this movie might be to rent out a good silent movie, like Abel Gance's Napoleon or anything featuring Chaplin.  The subject appears to have pushed Gibson back to the roots of cinema: gestures and faces.  Thankfully not everything is subtitled.My overall conclusion: 3.85 stars out of 5.  I don't hold with those that think this is the greatest movie ever made.  The Christian Word -- which includes the dogma of a personal Savior and all the eccentricity that may go with it --is  inherently incapable of a 5 star movie, or a 5 star artwork of any kind.  The closest post-Biblical Christian literature came to 5 stars was Dante, who admitted his failure in his Divine Comedy's last line, and that was a supreme admission from a very proud man and ought to set us all to fear and trembling.  Rembrandt for the most part gave us a lot of 3.75 star Jesus paintings, and to borrow from Hemingway, he probably had the best shot at the title.  Well, there is a fine Rembrandt etching of the Crucifixion that clocks in at about 4.1.  As for the movies, every sincere effort gives you a facet of the Christ -- Jeff Hunter in King of Kings, teamed up with Nicholas Ray behind camera, was heading for a 4.3 maybe, but as we say in Indy town, he \"kissed the wall.\"  See it again anyway and ignore a lot of the script (based on the top \"scholarship\" of its day, by the way).Saint Bernard, a.d. 1200, saw the West taking a questionable turn before the Renaissance, as far as religious art is concerned:  a return to sheer classic realism is a gain, of course, but also a loss because the room for the personal vision is thereby limited.  If you have seen Michelangelo's Pieta you cannot imagine that scene ever another way.  I thus don't grant any Michelangelo, DaVinci, Raphael, Bernini etc more than a 3.7 when it comes to Jesus Christ.  Mel gains not because he's more talented than those guys, but because those guys are his school and he builds on them.  Many justifiably still prefer icons in this particular competition.John the Apostle even threw in the towel on this one, you know: \"He said many other things but not all the books in the world ....\" & etcetera.  So as our famous dean of American realism might have put it, \"Don't get into the ring with John the Apostle.\"Of course, Mel did get into the ring, didn't he?  Of his hubris there is no doubt -- its just not very apparent in this movie, though, scene by scene -- or at least on the surface.  As for even undertaking the project -- sure, that's some hubris, all right.  But Gibson's stepping into this ring only proves that in the realm of art, certain rules can be broken if counter-balancing compensations are made.  Here, as in much of the best art of this country, the bow was to the aesthetic of realism with both feet.  The movie has much more in common with Clint Eastwood's unflinching look at the old west in The Unforgiven than with any filmed version of any didactic tract or religious text.  If you want your didacticism plain, go see a Star Trek movie and may be the wind be at your back.As for this film, there's enough going on in it -- including much not mentioned here -- that you should avoid as much of the debate as possible, even or especially from Mel's friends, and just go see it with an open mind as to what will hit you from a talented believer shrewdly aware of both his own limitations and those of film generally.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Trying to Look at the Passion Dispassionately", "unixReviewTime": 1128124800, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2005"}

However, the cinematography, acting, directing, etc. are all tremendous.  It is too strong for children, so don't let your non-teen children see it unless you want them to have nightmares of bloated-eyeball Jesus.  It is a gory torture movie full of blood, pain, and little else.  That said, I think it should be required viewing for everyone else on Earth.  Historically, religiously, and culturally, the film is a triumph, and seeing it make $300 million + at the box office amidst all the cruddy kiddy movies was extremely satisfying.  But don't listen to me--you've already probably decided whether or not to see it.  Here is what this movie will be remembered for after all the hype dies down.Passion is an anomaly within its admittedly odd circle of like-minded films.  Compare 10 Commandments, Ben-Hur, King of Kings, etc. to this film and you get the feeling that the Christians have finally caught up to the realistic standard in cinema since those films were released nearly 50 years ago.  It really is a step forward even from Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, which was released over 15 years ago.  (If you hate that film, by the way, you probably haven't seen it.  It's a beautiful expression of faith in its own right.)  Finally, Gibson takes the bible-history movies into this millenium.Passion is a film made by Christians for Christians.  I know many atheists who saw the film, however, and at least respect the principles of Jesus now.  If anyone says that this is not an achievement, then they know nothing about the difficulties of trying to preach to the uninitiated.  Those people on the street corners handing out flyers get spit on daily; they have guts, too.  Think they're nuts if you want, but admit their determination is uncommon.In the same way, it's necessary to appreciate the message of this film:  this is the man we have based our religion on, and this is what we know he went through.  In dealing only with the tribulation of Jesus, Gibson reduces belief to pain.  Would you suffer physical pain for the notions you hold true?  Few would.  This, my friends, is why we still see him as a model for the rest of us.  Jesus had inner strength uncommon in man.  Gibson is no savior, but he does remind us of something vital with this film.Mel Gibson has a lot of guts.

Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel \"Sadist\" Gibson, I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe, but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim. In short, it's just a movie, not a particularly good one, with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what's happening or to make you care. It looks terrific---Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness. But that's about where the praise ends. The whole thing has a nasty tone; in Mel's version of the tale, anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery, and while I'm not a believer myself, my guess is that's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it. And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end, eyes a-blazin' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack, I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to \"Braveheart Part II.\" Mel Gibson is a wretched director, and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously, for that gives them clout they don't deserve. All he's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie, complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire \"Friday the 13th\" series. This stuff was camp 30 years ago, and it's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie's complete lack of narrative grounding.

It's a dark and disturbing look at the last 24 hours in Jesus' life. Its dialogue is all in original tongue (Aramaic and Latin) giving the film a wonderful ancient perspective never before experienced. It's a movie that has an amazing amount of power.Here's what's not so good, it appeals solely to Christians. There is no doubt in Mel Gibson's mind that Jesus is the Son of God. From the appearance of Satan though out the film to the earthquake after Jesus dies, Gibson reminds us that it is not a man we see but God in the flesh of man. As a result of this, it is not surprising that many Jews are offended by this movie. They are portrayed in not the kindness light. Which brings us to our next point, is it a movie about history or faith.In the end, this is a movie about faith.  Sadly, it would be a better movie if others, than just Christians, could access that faith. I don't think this movie tries to divide people or faiths, but any movie solely about a particular kind of faith is going to alienate others. I also know of many children who have seen this movie and I cannot recommend it for them. This is a graphic and violent film that promotes adult discussion about faith. It is not for kids. Finally, since this was such a controversial film, I am surprised by the absence of DVD extras, not even commentary.

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"", "helpful": [4, 11], "reviewText": "I caught Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* at the Albany Cinema. The latest film about Jesus Christ, messiah of the Christian faiths, Gibson's *The Passion* particularly plays on Christ's torture and crucifixion, beginning 12 hours before Christ's crucifixion. Throughout, Gibson expresses his own passion, while portraying images of abuse, demons, and Jews so over-the-top it sets an altitude record.Down-to-earth, *The Passion* impresses me. It plays as if the makers understood they dealt with a time-honored tale, but wanted to avoid a rehash. Likewise, it plays to impress today's comfortable Americans with the magnitude of Christ's suffering as imagined by Gibson. Finally, I get the impression Gibson drew parallels to his own self-destructive behavior and feelings.As such, *The Passion* draws not entirely unexpectedly from horror films. Gibson sets the audience up with enough jump scenes to rival *Freddy versus Jason*; darkened doors fly open and women jump. Gibson shows people suddenly punched, or snakes abruptly stomped on, or pieces of property slammed about, usually in dark hallways and corners. CGI demons abound in these places; in one case, literally coming out of the stonework. Children sprout reptilian teeth and cloudy eyes as they torment a guilt-ridden Judas. Creepy crawlies crawl out of Satan. In the last scene for Judas, Gibson focuses most on the leering corpse of a decaying donkey. Necro-fans will love this film.So will sadists and masochists. As soon as Jesus surrenders, about fifteen minutes into the film, he is severely beaten, choked cursed, and spat upon. After spending the night in chains, Christ is beaten all the way to the local Roman governor, beaten to King Herod's, beaten back to Pontius Pilate, and thrust upon Roman soldiers who are ordered to chastise Christ. These soldiers obey their liege's orders in a lengthy, graphic torture sequence. Christ carries his cross even though he can hardly walk; Gibson repeatedly shows Jesus collapsing and being beaten as he lay. With another graphic depiction, Gibson takes us on a guided tour of crucifixion.Gibson also managed to pull some interesting rabbits out of his hat with this film. Satan is portrayed as a pale, sexless anti-muse, softly persuading Christ to deny God. Its minions are equally androgynous imps: children with wrinkled leers and deep crow's feet. A brief shot of Hell shows a barren, ridged wasteland, littered with blackened skeletons of unidentifiable creatures.Yes, the demonic imagery made quite an impression on me in this film. I found it more disturbing and memorable than the bloodshed and the suffering of Christ. This is an unfortunate distraction from Gibson's story, but that's what happens when a Hollywood darling and action megastar makes a supernatural movie.Gibson's portrayal of Jews is a more complicated distraction. *The Passion* itself may not be anti-Semitic, but whether by accident, unconsciousness, or design, *The Passion* clearly portrays Jews as the earthly masterminds of Christ's fate.Jewish priests arrest Jesus and condemn him to death. Backed by a raging mob of Jewish citizens, the priests threaten rebellion if Governor Pontius Pilot fails to kill Jesus. Pilot authorizes Jesus' torture to placate the mob.Although sneering Roman soldiers inflict the most heinous tortures seen, Gibson repeatedly takes the camera back to the Jews looking over their shoulders, Satan wandering among the priests. The Roman torturers and guards periodically look over their shoulders in fear of the mob. Unsatisfied, the bloodthirsty Jews threaten to smear Pilot's name as an enemy of Caesar.By now Gibson portrays the crowd as so threatening that Roman guards must beat them back. Pilot, his wife, and his commanding officer are visibly disturbed by the very idea of killing Jesus. All of them speak lines indicating their good faith.-particularly Pilot, who is seen as possibly recognizing Christ's divinity. But the fear that Caesar will have their heads if the Jews rebel inspires them to cave in, and Gibson shows us an endless parade of frothing, jeering Jewish peasants hounding Jesus to his doom.*The Passion* left no question in my mind that the Romans are unwilling victims of Jewish force. It unmistakably emphasized Jewish pressure for Christ's demise. Critics who deny these elements must have seen a different cut of the film.Overall, I walked away inspired more by Gibson's passion than that of Christ. I like his choice to use period language, and I mock people who think he should have filmed in English. I also respect his vision; even if it struck me as a masochistic drama replete with distracting iconography and horror-movie elements, it also struck me with the power of Gibson's convictions. Gibson drives his convictions home with a desaturated, over-exposed cinematography reminiscent of *Saving Private Ryan*.It is a shame, then, that *The Passion of the Christ* is only okay. It distracted me with the scale of the blood and gore and the prominence of the demonic imagery. And whether intended or not, Gibson plainly tips the balance of blame towards Jewish people. Still, it is a powerful story, cutting to a center of the Christian faith. I don't blame people who deny any distractions or anti-Semitic impressions, except to say they need to see the movie again and pay closer attention. Gibson did not make me believe Christ was a real person, let alone one that died for my sins. He sure made me believe his own sincerity, though, and I commend Gibson's passion; it inspires me to express my own views in public forums.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Passion of the Gibson", "unixReviewTime": 1091318400, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2004"}

But among the Christian community (of which I consider myself a part) and open-minded people who actually saw the film, The Passion stands alone as the most eloquent expression of God's love for mankind ever to grace the big screen.The Passion certainly is violent, but not anymore violent than similarly rated films of the past ten years. But despite contentions by some evangelical Christians that everyone should see this film, I don't think young children should see it. This movie is for mature audiences only, and I think anyone under the age of sixteen should have a full understanding of the previous events underlying the main focus of the film before viewing it.The entire movie was filmed in the original Aramaic with English subtitles. This enhances, rather than detracts from, the film's enjoyment because it creates an emotional aura of mystery and sacredness to the subject. Since most people are at least vaguely familiar with the storyline, you won't find yourself distracted by reading subtitles as one might think. With just the opposite effect, you find yourself paying greater attention to the visual images displayed on the screen, and the power of the events unfolding before you is amplified several times over.The Passion of the Christ combines the four written accounts found in the New Testament Gospels to create a vivid and powerful portrayal of the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.The film opens in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus of Nazareth (James Caviezel) is engaged in prayer, asking his Father to deliver him through the events soon to come. A satanic figure lurks in the shadows, dispensing a series of temptations and doubts. \"No one man can bear the sin of the world. It's impossible. It's too much,\" the figure says. When Jesus refuses to give into Satan's temptations, his disciple Judas arrives to betray him to the Temple Guard...Gibson's cinematic genius is apparent by his measured and precise use of flashbacks which draws the audience away from the violence in brief intervals so as not to cause an emotional overload. Flashbacks include Jesus teaching to a crowd about his power to \"lay down my life, and take it back up again,\" Jesus washing the feet his disciples at the last supper, and Jesus as a playful personality interacting with Mary. One particularly powerful scene traces back to Jesus as a toddler. When he falls down and injures himself, a panicked Mary runs to his rescue. This flashback correlates with the film's portrayal of Jesus stumbling under the weight of the cross.Overall, this ranks as one of the greatest films ever made. If you believe Jesus of Nazareth was the Biblical Messiah (which this film reviewer does), then The Passion illustrates the enormity of God's sacrifice. But even if you think Jesus was just a mere mortal, this film serves a valuable purpose in that it underscores the barbarity of a human race that, more often than not, persecutes the innocent.

I went twice to watch it in theaters and was appalled by the \"audience\" awaiting admittance. The first time, I was walking from the parking lot to the box office when a small bus pulled up and a church Sunday school group that included roughly a dozen small children (ages 5 to maybe 8 roughly)hopped out with chaperones. I got in line behind them and listened to the adults talking about the number of times they had each seen the film and how much they were looking forward to discussing it with the children afterwards. Having been previously advised from numerous places of the \"realism\" of the torture sequences and crucifixion, I decided the greater \"horror\" for me would be in seeing these small children react to the supposedly graphic violence. I simply walked back to my car and went home. The second time (a few weeks later after the initial \"rush\" of people going to a new movie had died down a bit)I actually managed to purchase a ticket and was waiting in the lobby for the previous screening to let out. A few minutes later, the doors opened and the crowd began shuffling out. Once again there were several families with small children. While the parents attempted to masquerade their emotional reactions by blinking and talking about how the sudden bright sunlight was \"tearing\" them up, the children weren't old enough to be embarrassed about showing feelings in public. Most were openly sobbing, all had red eyes, and one small girl (perhaps 4 or 5 years old at most) was shaking so badly that her dad had to pick her up, console her, and carry her outside. Once again, I was so upset and angry I had to leave.Now that I've seen it with my own eyes I can see why those kids were so freaked out.Although I don't belong to one of the most commonly known denominations, I am a Christian. I am also a daily reader of the scriptures, and have lectured on biblical scripture and prophecy all over the Eastern U.S. in churches and seminaries, as well as on college campuses. In other words, while I wouldn't define myself as an expert on all things God, I'm a bit more spiritually \"seasoned\" than most laypeople.The life of Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Bible, is centered around the final 3 years of his earthly life. His birth is depicted - especially in regards to the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and Jewish traditions - and there is a brief mention of his youth in the book of Luke. There are literally dozens of events during the 3 years of Christ's earthly mission that are filmworthy. In fact, the sheer number of films made about his life stand as proof of that fact. Did the world truly need a story that not only focuses primarily on Jesus' final week, but uses every means of modern effects to splatter gore and depict the massive agony endured by the Son of God? Maybe I'm in the minority (apparently, I should say) but I don't need to watch Jesus writhe and scream with each strike of the lash in order to respect and understand the sacrifice such suffering represented. I didn't need to personally witness the nails being driven in, the biblical depiction sufficed. The Glory of Christ's sacrifice is not found in his willingness to endure pain and death in God's name. Literally hundreds of millions of ordinary people have done that before Christ's birth as well as after. The Glory of Christ is found in the Word of God that came from his lips and the power of the Holy Spirit that transformed the entirety of humankind.We are asked to live the message and believe in Christ's name. We are not required to bear witness to the atrocities committed to his human vessel.But most important of all, I deeply believe that forcing or allowing small children to endure the trauma of watching the torture and murder of someone they have been taught to love above all others is not only unnecessary, but borders on abuse. Learning of the Passion from the Bible or from suitable talks with parents, clergy, and Sunday school teachers should be enough education for a small child to understand that God loves them and that Jesus can live within their hearts.Mel Gibson may have had the best intentions (my right to judge ends at the tip of my own nose) but I am of the opinion that the end result represents a massive and grotesque misjudgement.Feel free to slam this review if that is your wont.

It is still very interesting.I learned a lot from all of these Bonus Features! For instance, they shot most of the film using different frames per second, to make motions look more graceful. Also, there's talk about things like Satan's old baby, finally explained by Mel! This shows how evil mimics good things, but when you look closer, the perversion is revealed.

All through the movie, we see the demons, Satan, the snake taunting Jesus and the important aspect here is how Jesus handled this.

Wolf", "helpful": [7, 21], "reviewText": "Problem 1: People who take on side immediately, only because they want to feel connected to the \"mass\" pop-culture audience.  This is no mystery or suprise; be it sports, fashion, cars, vacation spots, etc., people desire connection to larger things mostly out of dissapointment from their own failures, losses, and frustrations.  Gibson did not just pander to the religious-right bible thumping deep south fanatics, but what he really was after was placing blame square on someone's shoulders: seeing that Morgenstern's father had to beg Mel to cut out the blood be on your children part, it's pretty straightforward as to where he comes from and who he wishes to demonize.  Furthermore, Gibson is staunchly Roman Catholic, demanding that people follow him and keep prayers in the Latin tongue...umm, alright Mel, frankly that whole side to you is lame and passe; it's like saying to someone \"Hey, do these prayers my way or the highway!\"  Mel really looked to place blame and rekindle old doubts and frictions between the Vatican and the Middle East; perhaps he had is way in that respect.  Main Point: Mel loves his Vatican and old religious practices and tried to turn the good Christians in America toward the side of the Vatican.  Result: very bad move.Problem 2: Religion or Race?  What is really more important and deeply engrained in the minds of most peoples?  Do you cast greater prejudice on grounds of physical features or religious affiliations?: Answer, race motivates on a deeper, actually realistic level as compared to phony religious claimings.  All of the worlds struggles, great conflicts, boil down to nationalistic pride and xenophobia more so than religious differences; e.g. the Persians allowing Jerusalem to be a site of worship for all peaceful peoples.  The real cancer on the Earth today is still the Vatican, which is itself pagan and by no means perfect (crusades, persecutions, papal bullying of nations including England and Germany by Romes legions, grand inquisition, etc.).  Will there ever be an African Pope?  Ha, not bloody likely.  Let's be real people, the world is determined and judged not by titles or teams (though commendment and numbers do help a cause) but by physical looks and similarities to our own ideals and preferences.  Main Point: Cut the nonsense, this world of ours is a cyclic sphere of national aspirations and individual coruption when faced with far-reaching decisions.  Result: we judge not by content of character or work ethic but by ideals.Problem 3: Religious difference as excuse for Racial decimation.  The Vatican, Mel's favorite big brother, that old institution in Rome once hellbent on ruling the world (how dare these thugs in robes who do little work...Karol Wojytola or John Paul II as an exception...and do absolutely nothing for science or human alleviation but would rather tell women how to live and enjoy old religious ceremonies tell whole nations and unique peoples such as Russia and China how to live) has been shown in the last few years (child molestation and financial fraudulence) to be highly corrupt and hypocritical.  How can Rome try to invade England and ruin Germany and deploy Spanish troops to Ireland hundreds of years ago, leaving death and destruction in their wake (Mel should have thought harder when making Braveheart, but being chauvanistic as he is, he forgot how the Scottish painted their faces blue and fought off Catholic Roman and Spanish troops trying to invande and take over the British Isles, not fight the English who have been a model nation to the world in regards to civilty and scientific thought...Newton ring a bell anyone?).  Main Point: for a nonspiritual demagoguery such as the Vatican to escape unscathed for what they've done to so many nations who were gentle and intellgent and progressive all until Catholic dogma invaded, they've really dodged quite a few bullets.  However, their time is running out.  Result: a world growing increasingly tired of relgious teachings as their ever evolving senses tell them of its use as a pretext for conquests and plundering.Problem 4: As the brilliant Harvard professor Samuel Huntington has portrayed in his books on clashes of cultures and remaking world order, the world is by no means stable.  Not even after civil wars, revolutions, world wars, coups....none have secured the longlasting peace so hoped for by many, but not all (e.g. thugs, gangs, criminals, dictators - the less intelligent real-life monsters of past and present).  The world of tommrrow is not one of religion (even south america is growing apart thanks to hugo chavez's finger pointing at america) but one of national identity...ironically, that has always been the case.  Main Point: integration and segregation continue to pull at eachother, fracturing America more than ever before.  The unrealistic thoughts of everyone \"liking\" each other and just \"getting along\" are over, and have never been much more than false words for false security.  Result: An America and Western world that wakes up to the threats from the east, a new China that could be peaceful partner or worst nightmare, and countries forced to take extreme measures due to unwanted influences (i.e. muslims taking over London's streets, France becoming a barnyard bash that doesn't work, and China wanting to remain a cultural empire unhinged by capitalism.  The world will survive and grow as old ideas of how to do just such collapse across the globe.  Dogma fails while reason, service, and a new humanity to all neighbors, be they of any race, flourishes.  The Herculean Man-God ideal fades as people grow tired of God being white, black, asian, green, blue, etc.  The world matures, people relax spiritually, and scientific advance continues to do some good, some bad.

But we are sinful by nature and there is penaty for sin, but the only penalty is death. we would have had to all perish because the debt that is owed is far too great. So Jesus came to earth as a man to make a bridge for us to the father God, and also had to die for everyone so we would have an oppertunity to be with the father. Jesus didn't want to die...I think he was actually scared and asked the father if there was another way.

That doesn't lessen the impact of the film for me.The experience of this film was a very personal one for me as the viewer. None of the unrealistic 1950/60's films' bloodless and passionless depictions, none of the Mary looking like an fair Irish lass out of a holy card--barely registering emotion at the foot of the cross, none of the WASPY looking blonde blue eyed actors, or aloof Jesus....Thank goodness!

Since there is no perfection except in God, then God himself must be sacrificed, and this is done through the death of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ, who is one with the Father and the Holy Ghost.  Thus mankind's sins would remain upon us unless this perfect atonement is made, offering the possibility of life everlasting in heaven with God.So the question arises, is all this torture necessary for the atonement to occur?  Must Christ have experienced this incredible gory and terrible torture to take the sins of the whole world upon him?  As the sacrificial lamb, must he endure considerable pain and loss of blood, to take the sins of the world on his shoulders? I think not. It is the death of the innocent lamb that is the sacrifice and atonement for the sins of the whole world, not the endurance of the considerable bloody torture that leads to the atonement. It is the giving of his life, a pure, perfect, sacrifice that is the atonement for all of mankind's sins.So this leads to the question of why so much blood and gore?  Was Gibson trying to say that mankind is so terrible that we do not deserve the sacrifice and atonement? Well there is no question there for surely we know mankind not to be deserving of complete and perfect grace upon our own merits, either as a species or individually. Was there some commentary about the religious and political establishment being made by the torture scenes?  Well, it was organized religion and organized political oppression that together brought about the torture and death, to be sure, but is Gibson trying to say that organized religion in partnership with an oppressive central government is capable of great cruelty to the innocent, even unto God in a human state of existence?  I never got the impression that the meaning of the film and sequence of scenes was really strategically thought through and thus in some ways this is only a terribly vicious, painful, gory snuff film with little reflection on the meaning of the sacrifice and atonement which are central concepts in Christianity and far more important than the nasty beating scenes where the flesh is literally pulled off the back and ribs of Christ.Does a sensationalistic portrayal of the passion of Christ do a service or disservice to Christianity? It really does neither for the movement of the Christ goes far beyond our ability to conceptualize the vast mystery of why atonement is necessary and why God himself, in the human form of Jesus, must make that sacrifice. For muddled thought and purpose, this film only gets 3 stars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "What does the atonement mean?", "unixReviewTime": 1254787200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2009"}

No, this one will pledge it's vision into my skull for a long time even if I never watch it again.The \"Passion\" is probably partly based on less extreme Passion plays that are featured around the world as a commemoration of Christ's death.  It is clear, though, that Gibson went for the throat with this film.  There is no question here.  You either sympathize with the devastated Christ or you have no soul.  That's the message of this film.  The plight of Judas Iscariot is no less powerful than that of his Master becoming the victim of circumstances that he could not forsee in his greed and power hungry heart.The fleshed out depictions of the spiritual forces of evil add a wickedness to the story that draws a clear disinction between Christ and the great Accuser, Satan, who is played by a woman to give the ancient rival of God a clearly feminine cast.  Not sure why Gibson felt that was necessary, but it is visually stunning.The beating of Christ, however, is the most gruesome feature of this film.  No one below the age of 17 should be allowed to see it.  It is so real and cruel that it makes one wonder if the human race is worth saving at all, if it cannot do any better than this.  The wounds are horrid.  The blood is all too convincing.After this, the crucifixion is almost anti-climatic.  Almost.

Sin cuts Man off from God; Christ mission was to seal that breach. \"Look, Mother,\" he says, I make things right.\"Although I found the Aramaic initially annoying, Gibson paced and placed the subtitles so that you could follow along without missing a scene.  It seems the choice of language is two-fold: one to appropriately depict the language of the times and also, I believe to keep us slightly distant from such a painful display - as though we had some way to look back at it all.  Gibson was extremely brave because the scourging and crucifixtion are extremely painful to experience and could have sent people away in droves.  However, I think Gibson tries to focus on the purpose of His suffering.  Satan (wonderfully protrayed as a mocking amorphous being) confronts Christ in the garden and tells him that NO ONE MAN can take on the sins of the world  - and that's why such a display of violence: each lash, each drop of blood, each thorn, each nail, is sin upon sin visited upon Him so that Man would not suffer separation from God.

On a moonlit night the clouds part and bathe a figure crying out in a garden, his soul wracked with torment, in white light. The man is the Messiah, Jesus, who only days before was welcomed into Jerusalem as a holy man and king. His disciples are asleep nearby, despite his pleadings for them to stay awake and pray with him. From the shadows a figure observes, mesmerizing but evil to the very marrow of his soul. The shadow is Satan and deception and selfishness are his tools as he urges the Christ to give up this road, to let mankind atone for their own sins. But Jesus refuses to submit to the seductive lies of the deceiver and symbolically crushes Satan's pet serpent under his heel.In the Jewish Temple Judas stands before the High Priests. He has been promised thirty pieces of silver for betraying the Christ. The coins scatter around him on the floor and he hastily bends to pick them up. Torches illuminate the night as he leads them to the Gardens to arrest the Messiah. The disciples resist but Jesus comes willingly into the Temple Court. At the moment of his arrest Mary, his mother, awakens in torment, certain something terrible is happening. John has managed to escape and comes to fetch her and Mary Magdalene. They are not allowed inside the counsel but there Jesus is questioned, slandered, spit on, and sent to the Romans in order to plead for his execution. Pontius Pilate's wife Claudia has awoken from a nightmare and begs him not to sentence the \"king of the Jews\" to death. But Jesus has been sent to earth to bear the burden of sin for mankind. The penalty is persecution, merciless beating, and eventual crucifixion.One of the most emotionally disturbing but profoundly touching films to come out in a long time, The Passion of the Christ has arisen great controversy, and for good reason. Between the themes and the brutality, there is a lot not to like... and a lot to appreciate both as a believer, and as a scholar of history. This film is visually stunning to the point of being overwhelming. Its subject matter is extremely dark but mesmerizing. The slow arch of the bag of coins as it flies through the air into Judas' outstretched hand... a close up of Mary Magdalene as Jesus cries \"It is finished\"... the tears on her face, the wind slowly caressing her hair... the captivating but disturbing image of Satan watching Jesus flogged nearly to death with great pleasure, holding a child-like demon in his arms. These characters are real. You empathize with the good and hate the bad. For an instant when he first appears you're mesmerized by Satan, wondering if the apparition is an angel... but then you realize the truth. The malice in its eyes, the cold deception of its words. Jesus is someone you instinctively love. You pity Him, feel each of the blows... flashbacks illuminate moments of His extraordinary life. The acting is so good you don't even think about the actors... it's too real. I loved the enhancement on James Caviezel's eyes... they are absolutely spellbinding, full of love throughout torment.Catholics will appreciate the symbolism rampant throughout, as well as nods to traditional Catholic teachings and the writing of Josephus. There are mild deviations from scripture and a few of the writers' additions are unexplained, but the film is one we should all see at least once.

For those who know the stories from pilgrimage times, all of the pieces of following the trail of Christ are there.  In some South American countries doing this reenactment is still very popular around Easter.For those of you who don't like subtitles, this movie might be confusing.  I found it hard to follow some of the characters, since they aren't named very often.  Also, a friend of mine who knows Latin didn't think that the subtitles translated all of the dialogue, but that might be a matter of interpretation, too.

Its method is to suffucate its recepient by nailing the person in a seated possition without any buttocks or back support, while hanging dependently with its nailed hands across, along with the feet nailed together, that the criminal crucified would thus be forced to pull its body upward through its nailed hands, while using the nailed feet to push upward in order for some air to come into it's lungs by lifting its body , so as to loosen the strangulation caused by the rib cage , when a person is set in such a possition . This movie THE PASSION Of The Christ, focused itself on the last days (or rather hours) of Christ in its intentional means to fully visualize the torture and great hardships that Christ went through in order to die for the sins of mankind as a means of retribution to save men's souls -- through loosely unbiblically based dramatization sequences with the help of amazing make up prosthetics and special effects, and with the means to emote a lot in its scenes for that matter - which could've saved itself of some - if they only stick with the facts to be authentic with the details, like if they studied enough and get the idea of how the crucifixion really works, it would've simply saved the producers all of the trouble by trying to be so gory dramatic in the number of sequences for this film. As it is that the main idea of director Mel Gibson and its production is to show the viewers how much Christ have suffered, and gain the viewers's conviction about it. However, the movie have in that aspect have studied the type of lashing methods which are being used in that time that Christ have recieved, peculiarly, even based on the enigmatically fraudulent TURIN SHROUD findings.Supported by the Jesuits, this Mel Gibson film heralds to share the sentiments of the Catholics with regards to Mary. However biblical it is with the emphasis concerning the Jews who have the part of pushing Christ into his death by crucifixion, which caused the protest within the Jewish community for the film as \"anti-semetic\" -- the movie's main purpose is to pull up the sentiments concerning the Saviour's sacrifice for mankind's sins and their retribution.Through flashbacks along with its storylines sequences, the movie is uncanny to the viewer in its presentation - that it is devoid of any detailed explanations for the scenes as if it have totally considered that all who would view the film are already familliar of the story of Jesus Christ. Let alone who would comprehend what are the things that are going on in the motion picture if one is totally unfamilliar to any of the accounts of Christ written in the Bible.However though, the film is a success as far as its tear-jerking factor is concerned as it have been effective in that aspect to the most of its audiences.Furthermore, if in any case an athiest would watch the film should he be convinced or moved about the saviour, when the movie seemed to only have its strongest appeal to those who are already symphathizers of the faith. \u000bAnyhow, given that if it is indeed the idea that Christ's mission on earth is to open up an access for the salvation of mankind by dying on the cross and through sufferings-- then God is fond of using irony indeed.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "To Nail or not to nail", "unixReviewTime": 1081641600, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2004"}

I know that whatever I say will be a magnet for negative votes. So I may as well just be honest about it. I found the movie by turns beautiful and infuriating. When I think back over it more of the infuriating stuff comes up, and yet I was moved a number of times during the film. sometimes the movie seems to be cheap and exploitive and sometimes it is pierced through with an obvious spiritualityFirst of all....the good things about the film. The visuals are actually quite beautiful, like a Carravaggio come to life. Gibson is obviously highly influenced by Counter-Reformation ideals of art (with both good and bad results I think) but as for visual beauty, you can't do much worse than that for inspiration.I found many of the \"small\" moments to be the most compelling. The healing of Malchus, the High Priest's servant was very moving, perhaps the one moment in the movie where you got an inking of why Jesus' death is supposed to be a greater tragedy than the suffering of countless other Jews in Palestine during that time. The Denial of Peter was also very moving, though this is the one story in Holy Week that is always guaranteed to reduce me to tears. I relate to Peter rather strongly. Some of the other flashbacks are equally powerful, if I think too short. Why we didn't get the entire scene of Jesus stopping the stoning of \"Mary Magdalene\" I'll never really know...it's one of the most beautiful passages in the Gospel of John.Okay...now the problems or questions. First of all, is the blame of Jesus' death placed on the Jews? Yes and no....it is certainly placed on the Jewish authorities. If you are to be at all faithful to the Gospels you can't get around doing this...so in that aspect the movie is as anti-Semitic as I believe the Gospel of Matthew and John are in parts. You can blame the movie, but the blame should go squarely at the source I think. To sweep this part under the rug, you have to cut out part of the Gospel.What concerns me more is the subtle anti-Jewish aspects of the film, Some of the aspects are so subtle that I don't think many people without a lot of background in Biblical history will catch them. For one thing, Gibson does not portray the Last Supper as a Seder. There is some disagreement in the Gospels on this point. Matthew, Mark and Luke place the Last Supper on the first night of Passover, while John places it on the last night before Passover. Gibson takes the last view, as he shows Jesus blessing and distributing pita bread rather than unleavened bread. This is a subtle point, but it reinforces the unconscious idea that Jesus wasn't really Jewish. And it's not the only example of this in the movie, just the most obvious.The worst scene to me is one that doesn't get much comment. Judas, in torment over his betrayal of Jesus is teased by a bunch of little children, looking like little Yeshiva boys in short pants and yarmulkes. (I'm not even sure that yarmulkes date back that far, but I need to research this. I do know that kids wouldn't have worn short pants!) The yeshiva boys then turn into demons. This \"attack of the killer yeshiva boys\" is perhaps one of the most evil things in the movie, being purely out of Mel's fantasy mind and having no bearing in scripture at all.Then there is the issue of the filmmaking itself. By focusing so exclusively on the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, Gibson leaves very little room for character development. If you come to this movie as a committed Christian, you probably will be moved, since you know the character of Jesus already. But for those without much familiarity with the story, the characters are hopelessly two-dimensional. We know that Peter, Mary, Mary Magdalene and others are moved and distraught over Jesus' execution, but we don't really know why from a motivational standpoint. Taking the last twelve hours of Jesus' life without at least a little insight into who Jesus was, robs the movie of context and robs the death of Jesus of it's context.Also, the focus of this movie is so unrelentingly on the death of Jesus as to be a theological distortion. Jesus' death is one of the central mysteries of the Christian faith, but only one of them, and perhaps not the most central. The Resurrection is what puts it all in perspective, and that's given very short shrift in this movie. This plus the extreme realism of the movie, actually defeats a Traditionalist viewpoint that Jesus was both Human and Divine.So, in conclusion, for me the movie was worth seeing. Even with all the caveats I mentioned, I did get something from the movie. It was akin to the kind of Ignatian meditation that I usually do on Good Friday. I think that if someone goes into the movie with a religious bent, you will come out with something. But if you aren't religious, this movie isn't going to convert you. You'll probably just feel lost and repelled.One final thought: the most disturbing thing about this movie to me didn't happen during the movie but happened at the end as the lights were coming up. Behind me an African-American man said to his date: \"Now I hate the Jews even more than I did before. They deserved what they got in the Holocaust.\" A chill went up and down my spine at that. to hear something like that come out of someone's mouth out loud scared me down to my bones.  While this may not be Mr. Gibson's fault, the movie is fanning the flames and he's done precious little to douse them!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "By Turns Beautiful and Frustrating", "unixReviewTime": 1079395200, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2004"}

But \"The Passion of the Christ\" stirs even more emotions, the most salient of which are anger, shock, and melancholy.  By tapping into the primary art medium of our time, the darkest slice of Christ's biography, his torture and execution at the hands of Jewish clergy and Roman authority, has once again asserted itself as the most influential story ever told.Opening in a Gethsemane bathed in blue light, director Mel Gibson quickly introduces one of his innovations, an androgynous and Druidic Satan figure who will flit through the rest of the narrative, appearing even on the via dolorosa carrying some sort of mutant child.Overall, however, the film is faithful, perhaps even excessively faithful, to the canonical gospel accounts of Christ's last hours.  It strives for realism enough to allow its characters to speak Latin and Aramaic, revealing Jesus' name as \"Yehosua,\" but it presents the miraculous as well:  Christ restoring a man's sliced ear or the temple cracking in half as the moment of Christ's death.  Most significantly, it presents the resurrection of Christ in a brief and artful scene in which he disappears from his tunic, which fluffs and falls, reconstituting himself as unblemished except for the holes of his stigmata.But Jesus is hardly unblemished through most of the film.  Unless you've moved into the rathole vacated by Saddam Hussein, you're aware that this 2004 film offers the most graphic presentation of Jesus' suffering in any Christ film yet.  His torturers are far more sadistic than in \"King of Kings\" or \"Jesus of Nazareth.\"  The scene of Christ's scourging has quickly become a conversation piece as the movie rules the box office.  Most of the Romans who administer the scourging are vicious thugs who seem to relish the destruction of a body.  Choosing a whip whose hooks tear flesh from bone, they render Jesus a bloody pulp from head to toe, exposing spongy subdermal layers and even a few ribs.  By the time the actual crucifixion occurs, we see an elbow bone poking through skin as well.  The first nail is driven in with a geyser of blood.This is not, however, gratuitous violence.  The suffering here is the point.  It is a statement and a sacrifice in the mind of the one suffering and his two billion believers.  Actually, Mel Gibson pulls his punches in a few places, since crucifixion involved asphyxiation and baking in the sun, neither of which isdepicted in \"The Passion.\"The acting and direction are solid, even excellent in \"The Passion the Christ,\" but the real star here is an ace cinematographer.  Certain visuals are seared on your brain after seeing \"The Passion.\"  These include the unctuous eyebrow-less devil with his mutant baby, the scenes of the two Marys taking linen and mopping what looks like gallons of Jesus' blood from around the scourging post, and the scene which finally brought tears:  As she watches her son fall with his cross, Mary remembers him falling as a little boy.  Maternal concern written all over her face, she runs to pick him up.  But 30 years later as she approaches her son, she is unable to aid him, only watch the gruesome spectacle.  His hair stringy, his face covered in blood and sweat, he assures her:  \"See!  I make everything new!\"Was anyone ever so misunderstood as Christ?  So many in the film from Pilate to Caiaphas just don't comprehend that Christ doesn't seek power in the material world but would rather direct our eyes to a simmering mirage on a distant dune, the lifeforce around and within us, the everlasting spirit that will survive our bodies whose oxygen addiction will prove fatal in 80 years.  Mutiple and brief flashbacks to the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper feature a robust charismatic Jesus, but perhaps these are too brief and too few as some have complained.  They might have been increased and lengthened to create a more effective counterpoint to the story's endless gore.Still, even this complaint may arise from discomfort with massive human suffering.  Doesn't a person with advanced HIV symptoms suffer like this?  How about a person standing near a Palestinian suicide bomber or withering in a Serbian death camp?

That meant I couldn't respond to the guilt trip Mel Gibson meant to put on everyone about how Jesus  suffered for everyone's sins, so I looked at it as just a movie. A very boring movie.First the good parts. I thought using the ancient languages worked very well as did the look of the film, which featured some good filter effects (the garden scenes) and a drab color palette that evoked the past more than a bright one would have. I also liked Maia Morgenstern's performance as Mary. She did an excellent job of portraying her mixed feelings of pride and pain. The sets of the city were good and there were some great landscape shots, especially from the mountains. I also thought the DTS soundtrack was very good.Those weren't enough to make this a good movie for me though. The beatings grew boring very quickly, which made the final half of the film very tedious for me. Mel Gibson mostly worked in caricatures, portraying the Roman soldiers as mindless brutes, the apostles as dim-witted cowards and the Jews as a rabid mob. James Caviezel did a good enough job playing an impossible role, but I didn't find someone covered in blood or woodenly quoting biblical passages particularly interesting. The scenes with the Satan character didn't work for me at all.There was also the problem that, if you weren't a Christian or familiar with the Christian mythology, this movie would have made no sense at all. I guess to Gibson this wasn't a problem, since he was making this film for a specific audience. That audience made him a lot of money, so I suppose the choices he took worked for his pocketbook. That does not make this a great movie though. (As far as the anti-Semitic question, I agree that this film qualified. The Jews suffered for centuries because of the \"Christ Killer\" label, and this movie echoed that belief. The Romans may have did the killing, but the Jews started the ball rolling, a fact Gibson hammered home repeatedly.

And people, it's okay to be catholic hater of this film or an atheist lover of it, but people seem to think you either are catholic and hate it or anything else and love. As for the anti-semitics? Please.The film chronicles the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life according to Mel Gibson so this film isn't a pseudo documentary where every event actually transpired(even if people doubt he actually existed). Anyway, the film starts with Christ being betrayed by Judas in the Garden of Gethsemane. Judas takes off and Christ is captured and others want him desperately to be punished. He's taken to Pontius Pilate, but he won't sentence him, King Herod won't either. But instead of risking a rebellion if Christ is freed, he orders his death by crucifixtion.While beautifully shot and some great performances even if you can't understand a word of Aramic or Hebrew, there is some problems. One: there's cases of extremes. The priests who want Christ are SO determined to get him sentenced. The Roman guards come off as extremely sadistic and almost seem to take pleasure with scourging Christ with poles and a vicious-looking cat o'nine tails(it looks like a claw). As for the violence, it is disturbing to a fault. There's a part where one of the claws is caught in Christ's side and is yanked, thereby pulling off some of his flesh. I don't know about you but does that seem necessary after such a brutal torture already? Or how about the 6, count em 6 times Christ falls when carrying his cross to the hilltop? Although one shot is can certainly be disheartening when Christ, nailed to the cross, has to be turned over but from the look of it, would hit the ground face first with the heavy cross crushing him although he's stopped. Quite an unnerving scene.  The Resurrection scene should definately have been longer also.The movie does have its strong points though. For one, the score done by John Debney is one to listen to as it's epic and moving. The cinematography by Caleb Daschanel is very well done, the performances, especially by Jim Caviezel(Christ) and Maia Morgenstern(Mary) are quite impressive too.

You might think Gibson should stick to making movies about burned-out, widower cops (with or without post-apocalyptic wasteland settings), but brother, you'd be wrong. He proved with \"Braveheart\" that he's adept at directing movies about rebellious, inspirational martyrs...and this time he graciously decided to let somebody ELSE play the starring role!Now, when this flick came out a couple of years ago, it was surrounded by controversy -- and not just because the title contains the word \"the\" more times than any movie except \"the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King.\" For one thing, a lot of people thought the movie was anti-Semitic, because a lot of the bad guys were Jewish. Of course, a couple of the GOOD guys were Jewish, too -- not to mention the fact that many of the bad guys were Romans, not Jews. In truth, the movie is more anti-moron than anything. Just look at the portrayal of the d-bags who cackle and hoot while whipping Jesus with that freaky, scaled cat o' nine-tails; they were practically wearing dunce-caps.People also criticized the graphic violence in the movie. Frankly, I found the gore to be somewhat tamer than I was expecting, but I've sat through Troma flicks without blinking an eye. The scourging and crucifixion of Jesus is pretty brutal, but it's counter-balanced by Jim \"Angel Eyes\" Caviezel's excellent moaning. That makes you feel pretty bad for Jesus. Apparently, a bunch of people cried in the theater at these scenes, but I haven't shed tears at a movie since I saw the last five minutes of \"Jason X.\" I will admit: I did find myself exclaiming \"Jesus!\" at a couple of points, which is actually pretty appropriate.While all this scourging is going on, a sinister figure constantly lurks in the background. He looks sort of like the dude in \"Powder,\" and in one scene even carries around a little \"Mini-Me\" who snarls at the camera. The film never makes it perfectly clear that this is supposed to be Satan, but the guy's lack of eyebrows makes you pretty sure that it's SOME inhuman force of evil (other than Whoopi Goldberg).Now, forgive me if I spoil the end of the movie, but Jesus is resurrected, and the final shot is him triumphantly standing up to leave his tomb and go kick some serious @ss. Jesus even has holes in his hands from the crucifix, which will cut down wind-resistance when he pimp-slaps evil. It's pretty cool -- I'm hoping Gibson decides to make a sequel, like \"The Passion 2: Operation Stranglehold\" or something.In truth, the most impressive thing about \"the Passion of the Christ\" was the marketing. Seriously, only Jesus himself has had a better Public Relations campaign. I mean, it's an okay flick, but they really made it seem like The Most Important Film of All Time.

The first focuses on the teachings of Jesus-especially the \"love your neighbor\" part.  The approach believes very much that Jesus came here and he had something to say.  The approach has had a long and honorable history within the Church.  Past a certain point it begins to break apart as far as exactly what it was Jesus had to say; but it is generally agreed that the message was of divine origin and reflected something about the mind of God.  In this regard, The Passion Of The Christ comes up short in that it is devoid of clear spiritual teachings.  Even the flashback to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount seems more than just a little subtle.  Instead we have a gut wrenching account of Jesus' sufferings on the way to the cross that is frankly more than many can endure.  Indeed, many members of the \"Jesus-Giver of Spiritual Wisdom\" school have a difficult time giving the crucifixion a meaningful place within the Gospel.  In some ways, by this viewpoint, the whole \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried\" part of the Apostles Creed seems more a distraction from the message of Jesus than an illustration of some moral message.  Thus several reviewers have remarked that Mel Gibson has utterly failed in his project by not placing the story of Christ's final twelve hours into a larger spiritual framework the viewer could walk away with.But there is a second approach.  This approach believes that the Gospel (and the secret of life for that matter) is not a collection of spiritual wisdom or a code of ethics and conduct.  This approach believes that the secret of life is a person.  In other words, Christ did not come to walk among us to get us to be better people or live on a higher spiritual standard.  Christ came to reconcile us to Himself.  He came so that we could place our trust in Him and trust in His righteousness to make us acceptable to a Holy God.  In this view, Gibson's movie makes sense.  The whole drawn out tale of the suffering Jesus makes sense because Jesus Himself is the point.It offends many that this one man in one particular time and concrete place is believed to be the meaning of it all.  It defies all reason and common sense.  Yet this is what the faith proclaims.  Hence at least some of the criticism this film has received is actually an expression of outrage at this very suggestion.There have been some complaints that in this version of Jesus' death that the Roman Governor, Pilate, is viewed with some sympathy.  Indeed, I think Gibson has done just that.  But whatever sympathy Gibson shows for Pilate is offset by the ghastly brutality of the Roman soldiers.  And troubled or not, Pilate cannot absolve himself of his part in the crucifixion by washing his hands anymore than he can declare himself a bird and fly away.At the viewing I attended, the audience was dead quiet throughout the entire film.  No one ate and only a few bothered to drink their sodas-those that did did so only to calm the upset in their stomachs.  Surprisingly, the toughest part of the film was not the hanging on the cross but when Jesus is beaten with a variety of whips.  To watch a man have the skin ripped from his body is an astoundingly harsh experience for the viewer.  It is with this particularly long scene in mind that I cannot recommend this film to younger filmgoers.This is a painful film to watch.  Most of the audience cried at some point.  A few had to leave the theater.  When it was over the audience walked out not speaking to each other.  This film is meaningful in the extreme to Christians long familiar with the habits of Lent and Easter.  It is definitely a Catholic view of the crucifixion-even so, it is not so oppressively Catholic that members of other denominations would find it distracting.  Most leave this film deeply moved and without regret for having watched it.Only time will tell if this film will have a lasting place among Christians.  I can scarcely imagine what place it will have in the world of filmmaking.  There is no other film like it.  The only film I have heard it compared to is Schnildler's List in its depiction of brutality.  It could be for that very reason it will be ignored in the long run by the film watching public.  Like Schnildler's List, it may be more honored than watched.  But this is an important film as a film.

I wish director/producer Mel Gibson had shown more of Christ's resurrection instead of centering 99 percent of this movie on his suffering, although I understand Mel's point.

Mel Gibson has made a film that shows us just a portion of what Christ suffered for mankind.  (It is important to remember that the word passion has a root that means suffering.)  If you don't believe or don't know the story the violence might be all you can see.  However, I saw Jesus reaching out with love, trying to teach, through all the torture and barbarity even while on the cross.  Tears come easily while watching this film because I know my sins put the whips and hammers in my hands and that Jesus was wounded for my transgressions, bruised for my iniquities, and that with his stripes I am healed.James Caviezel certainly portrays the suffering of Jesus, but more importantly he also always projects the absolute submission Jesus has to God's will and his boundless love for every human.  I particularly loved the scene where the man who had been compelled to carry Christ's cross to Golgotha looks into the eyes of Jesus and is tormented because of the love Christ still radiates.  I remember one of the negative reviewers said that the words of Christ asking his Father to forgive his tormenters (us) were not in the film.  That is wrong.  They are in there twice, when he is being nailed to the cross on the ground and another time shortly before he dies.The other actors are fine as well.  Hristo Shopov was very fine as Pontius Pilate as was Claudia Gerini as Pilate's troubled wife.  Monica Bellucci adds a haunting beauty as Mary Magdalene.  However, top honors goes to Maia Morgenstern as Mary.  She brings Mary to life as I have never seen before.  And when she looks straight in our eyes as she holds the broken body of her son you know she is not condemning us.  No, she is asking us to understand what her son (and she) gave for us and asks us to accept that sacrifice and let it change our lives.The actors who played the priests, the vicious Roman guards, and the crowds who called for Jesus' death should all be commended for powerfully playing those thankless roles.

It is essentially the Anselmian view that Jesus was incarnated as the only sufficient sacrifice for our sins.  As this movie presents it the only significant part of Jesus's life is his death.  It is this sort of blood-soaked religious ideology that says it is ok to kill people as a means of purification.Even as an atheist I can see that this is probably the most immoral of all ethical or religious doctrines.  If you want a sound theology try Abelard or some of the Franciscan authors.  In their writings the incarnation is the culmination of creation, an event that was planned from the beginning and NOT simply a reaction to \"people behaving badly\".  It represents the ultimate unification of God with His creation.  The moral lesson comes not from the death of Jesus saving us from our sins.  (which mires human beings in eternal stupidity and doesn't apparently cure us of sinfulness either ...so it is pretty much a wash) The moral message needs to come from Jesus's life...take care of lepers, eat with tax collectors, help a prostitute get on her feet.

The film doesn't pretend to be anymore than it is: a thorough examination of Christ's passion through graphic (one could not exactly say literal)depiction. Because of the film's intense focus, I gained a much deeper understanding of what exactly the passion of the Divine Christ was: His absolute, uncompromising, and, most of all, completely self-sacrificing love for humanity.By focusing on the essence of Christ's mission, in a brilliant exposition of the film-maker's art - we are shown the exemplication and demonstration of perfect self-sacrificing love, the true Altruism, which He was sent into this world to teach, and the intolerably brutal and vicious way in which we treated Him.To the credit of the film, we are not allowed for a second to forget that God's begotten Son took upon Himself the form of a man, and therefore, was subject to that human sensitivity which experiences pain and travail. And who among us, with all the agony we do experience, could have endured what He did for our sake?  Herein, the film shows us what Christian virtue is: to bear our Cross, without complaint or rebuke.  The film really does a superb work in showing us that Christ's passion for our betterment was great enough to transcend any agony which we could inflict upon the flesh.I understand the heart of Christ's teaching as stated in the Gospel of John to be thus:1) \"... that you love each other as I have loved you ...\";2) that \"... there is no greater love than this: that one might lay down their life for their friends (or enemies, or anyone at all)...\"What I don't understand is how one can watch this film and point a finger at anyone, Jew, Roman, Iraqi ... anyone, other than at themselves.

The Gospels are just (supposed) histories, not stories dreamt up for our entertainment. Hence, they can be difficult to fit into a movie format. Kudos for historical accuracy, but the more important question is, did Gibson emotionally connect the viewer with Jesus, so we personally felt he died to pay for our own sins? That may vary with each viewer. I felt no connection at all. Gibson tried a few skillful tricks in order to make the connection, but they didn't work for me. The lyricism I mentioned earlier detracted from an immediate connection. Maybe Gibson got a bit too wraped up with his own snazzy filmmaking technique.

And though this guarantees the film will make huge sums of money from the curious public, it also allows religion and theological clashes to overshadow what the analysis should be focused upon for any cinematic offering: the filmmaking. In that respect, The Passion of the Christ is very similar to recent critical-favorite Touching the Void. For the former, we see an hour of \"real time\" scourging, torture and crucifixion. The latter limits itself to about an hour of battling the elements, as a horribly injured man attempts to descend a perilous mountain. The problem in both cases is that an ordeal on film is made to be an ordeal for the audience, as well. Frankly put, too much of the same thing eventually becomes boring.The film begins with terrific atmosphere, as Jesus (Jim Caviezel), who claims to be the son of God, prays in a mystical forest under the guard of his disciples. Jesus knows that the Jewish authority, the Pharisees, believe he is a blasphemer and want him dead. As such, he prays to God mournfully as the specter of Satan attempts to turn him toward the dark side while Jesus is at his most vulnerable. Eventually, the Pharisees seize Jesus and a brief battle ensues. Jesus shakes the determination of one Jewish guard when he magically restores the guard's severed ear.The Pharisees eventually bring Jesus to the Roman ruler of the land, Pontius Pilate, demanding he be crucified for going against their established religious hierarchy. Pilate is extraordinarily conflicted about Jesus, seeming to believe in the qualities Jesus claims to possess. He sends the Pharisees away to seek the rule of Herod instead of his own, though Herod promptly refuses to condemn Jesus and he is sent back to Pilate by the increasingly bloodthirsty mob. Knowing that refusal to follow the will of the people would create a rebellion, Pilate begrudgingly sends Jesus to be scourged. However, even that is not enough for the accusers, led by Caiphas.What follows are essentially: 20 minutes of scourging, 20 minutes of bearing the cross up a hill, and 20 minutes of actual crucifixion. The film currently runs a bit more than two hours and gets tedious; trimming several minutes off the hill walk and a bit from the crucifixion would certainly improve the film's pacing. The visuals are indeed incredible, making us feel as though we are actually in the time and place of the events (the Director of Photography and Production Designer deserve recognition here), but even imagistic richness is not enough to counter endless repetition of the same thing.The same criticism can even be levied against Caviezel, as well as Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci (Mary and Mary-Magdalene, respectively). Though Caviezel totally embodies him here, Jesus spends much of the movie wincing, collapsing or heaving. Both Marys have little to do but cry as they watch the torture unfold. Morgenstern has an expressive face and captures the idea of a mother's grief well, but neither she, nor in particular Bellucci, have a whole lot to do in the movie.Mel Gibson's direction is incredible for visual splendor, but his ideas for pacing and variety leave much to be desired. Though the final moments of the film are uplifting ones, as we do see Jesus come back to life after his corpse was entombed, it seems Gibson's vision for the film was limited to the torture Jesus endured for his beliefs. Though it is no consolation to a bored audience, one can only expect singular focus from such a narrow vision.Regardless of what people may be saying, The Passion of the Christ is certainly not a life-altering experience. It is quite simply an artist's interpretation, of writers' interpretations, of ancient stories. As such, there is no reason for adults to bring children to the film in the guise that it is instructional. This R-rated film is certainly more deserving of an NC-17 than The Dreamers.

It was [way] better than Titanic (no offense Titanic fans)! Finally, I get to see what this film... or this true story looks like. First of all, this isn't a film. It was REAL!!! Big time! Now for my review. This movie opens up with Jesus (my favorite character... or person...) who is upset that he has twelve hours to live, because he is about to be crucified. Hours have passed and he was taken to the Romans. After they sentence to punish him, they start beating him up with chains, whips, and other dangerous weapons. I covered my eyes, because it was too painful. After they beat him up, they want to sentence him to death. So they have him carry a cross, while he is severely injured, but Mary thinks about the good times Jesus and her spend, including the close encounter part which really brought a tear in my eye. When we get there, they nailed Jesus on the cross and raise him up, but not before we see a flashback about his bread as his body and the drink as his blood. After he and his cross rose vertically, they knew the job was done, and everyone laughed at him. However, they clouds rolled in, and everyone knew what will happen: After Jesus prays to his father for the last time, he dies and he will be in heaven for sure. Rain starts to fall, causing a huge earthquake. Now, I think this is a little... flat, but the people who crucified Jesus NOW finally realized they did something wrong. They knew they did something bad to him, but it was too late for that. After they release Jesus from the cross, he is held by his mother, Mary. However, in April 3, the first Easter ever to be created, the covers he lied in when he died was empty, because Jesus is living with his father, but, before the credits roll, we see Jesus resurrected, proving that even though he died, he was still alive. I think the ending was so powerful, and, in my opinion, I think it was the best ending ever. It left my heart thumping for good. The only complaint was that there was no English dialouge, but there's not suppose to be an English dialouge, because it wasn't held in our region. I still think it makes sense to me. This movie is the best movie I've seen in Earth, and it should not be missed. GO SEE IT NOW!!! Well done Mel Gibson for giving us the gift of a powerful movie!!!

I had the priviledge of seeing last night and was not disappointed, but I should point out that this is the kind of film which you can't \"like\" or \"dislike.\"  The film stays true or mostly true to the Gospel it's based upon.  The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children.  Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney's engrossing music score.  James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others.  Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart.  I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel.  Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life, he's not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend.  It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film's budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film.  This is the second-highest grossing \"R\" rated film after The Matrix Reloaded.  Of course you shouldn't see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you're very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence.  The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal.  During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus's hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus's body is drenched with blood.  There's also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.  Though the film's violence might derive you from seeing this film, you should definetly experience especially at the movie theatre.

Sanderman", "helpful": [18, 22], "reviewText": "Well, at the time I am writing this, over 1,800 people have written reviews on THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  Now, regardless of whether these reviewers think the film is good or not, I think it is absolutely dishonest to say that the film is completely not worth seeing.  Any film that manages to spark so much controversy and polarize audiences is bound to be worth seeing-if only to get a glimpse for yourself of what people are talking about.  So, unlike most of my reviews, I will say upfront: THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is worth seeing.  In what follows, I will give you a sense of my thoughts as I was watching the film.During my childhood, I was a practicing Catholic and attended mass every week (often twice).  Each year, we would go through the Passion meticulously around Easter.  The story would be related several times, the stations of the cross would be observed, and so forth.  The upshot is, this is a story that any practicing Christian should know like the back of his or her hand.  Yet, despite the fact that I have heard this story so many times and seen so many films about it, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST manages to bring a different perspective and a whole-new-level of reality to the story that just cannot be communicated in spoken words.  Sure, I sat there waiting for each of the stations to occur.  I waited for the lines.  If you grew up in a church, you will know several of the film's lines before they are uttered.But I would like to focus on the film's graphic violence, since this seems to strike the largest amount of controversy in the entire movie.  Is it violent?  Yes, it is.  I would not recommend this movie for children.  But I don't know what everyone is so upset about.  The Passion is a violent story.  The brutality is described in the New Testament and, until Gibson decided to go for it, that brutality has never adequately reached the screen.  The story is supposed to center on Jesus, a man who is human and divine, suffering for all of the sins of humankind.  His suffering has to be greater than any other human being is capable of withstanding.  In previous films and versions, the lack of absolute brutality allows the audience to sit back and \"enjoy\" the Passion.  But this is not a story that is meant to be enjoyed.  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, in my opinion, is the only film that really \"gets\" that.  Gibson's \"bloodbath\" finally communicates, in horrifying detail, the absolute suffering of Jesus Christ.Now, regardless of whether you are a \"believer,\" I think you will get something out of this film.  I am no longer a practicing Catholic, but that doesn't prevent me from standing back in thoughtful contemplation after this film.  It is a good film and it is obviously a labor of love.  I think that it will stand the test of time and provide a powerful religious experience for those who are believers.  Some have complained that it doesn't preach \"Christian\" values.  If you think this, you are blind.  The quiet suffering of a man dying for the sins of humankind, praying for his torturers, is at the heart of the Christian faith.  Do not watch THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST to be entertained.  Watch it either to reflect on your own beliefs or to reflect on the beliefs of those around you in our society.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Passion: An Intense Depiction Unlike Any Other", "unixReviewTime": 1129852800, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2005"}

The movie does start at the climax of what happened to Christ, yet it shows in such horrific detail what Christ went through for out transgressions.

It is what it was whether we in our own human nature want to express our shame and utter disgusting human nature also known as fallen nature or not this movie shows exactly to what extent love can truly be portrayed in the most pure way.  Christ loves us and if we accept that He died for us then we have eternal life and that is what this movie made me truly understand and believe.

How am I supposed to fit into a puny 1,000 words or less how powerful and amazing this film is? I can't. It's amazing. I'll have to admit (at the cost of my pride) that this film even caused a few tears to stream down my cheeks...something I'm typically determined not to have happen. I've never cried for any other movie, but the utter determination, the love that bound my Savior to the cross was mind-numbing.Yes, it's violent. Frankly, it's landmark for me, being the very first R-rated film I've ever viewed in my life. But it was worth it, I have no regrets. And although you would know the best whether or not you have the intestinal fortitude to watch this, let me just offer you a few of my own reasons why I think you should.Jesus took this punishment for US. YOU should have been bound to that whipping block. I should have. Each and every one of us has sinned against God, and deserves no less than the most painful and brutal death Man can devise, with eternal suffering and condemnation to follow. We deserve that. By God's good grace, we are no longer bound to that doom. If our Savior had what it takes to endure that, to rescue us from that end, it would almost seem to me as if we at least owe him to look squarely in the face that which he endured for us.I've been a Christian all of my life, and generally, I'm guessing it is the case that most people accept the fact that Christ died for us, and we move on. Which is good, of course, don't get me wrong. If we all sat around agape at God's grace, we'd never get any of Heaven's tasks done. But I think the movie changes that acceptance...it forces us to go back and contemplate exactly how difficult of a concept God's grace truly is for our mortal minds to attempt to fathom. It makes us marvel anew. Throughout the film, I kept thinking \"He bore all that for me. For me!\"Yes, it's bloody. If you don't think you can watch the film without emblazoning disturbing images on your mind for life, then you probably shouldn't. Jesus died that death specifically so that we needn't suffer it. But I can attest to the fact that I don't think I'll ever picture Christ's death the same way again. To answer the old song's question \"were you there when they crucified my Lord?\", this movie will make you feel as if you were.About those pesky anti-Semitic charges. I'm reminded of the story of Daniel of the Old Testament, wherein Daniel's enemies were searching for a crime to charge Daniel with, but could find none, so they invented one. Besides the violence, anti-Semitism is about the only criticism one can find, and that only because of the hype. (And we all know how concerned Hollywood is about violence!) In truth, the allegation is preposterous. This film is history, dramatized. It is not responsible for stirring up hateful feelings any more than \"The Alamo\" stirs up hatred towards Mexicans, or \"Pearl Harbor\" against the Japanese.So why does this charge still supposedly remain an issue? The fact is, if you enter this film with the predetermined mindset that this film will contain anti-Semitic material, you know what? You could very well see some. I attempted to find some, and you know what? One can; IF YOU ENTERTAIN THE PRESUPPOSTION, then you'll find it. Because there's no doubt; the Jewish leaders were one of the two primary bodies responsible for the death of Jesus. But the Romans share the guilt heavily. They heartlessly scourge Jesus, beat him, mock him. It was a combined effort. But basically, the point is this. If you exit this movie with anti-Semitic tendencies in your heart, then, if you'll forgive the expression, you're dead wrong. You have no appreciation for the love of the Jesus that this movie is about. Also, you need to realize that if you hate those who put Jesus to death, then you hate yourself. It was your sin and mine that held Jesus to that Cross. To claim that it is the sole fault of either the Romans or the Jews is folly. It was our SIN. Yours. Mine. The world's.Like my subject line said, this movie is brutal, visually punishing. It's painful to sit there and watch the nails sink into the Savior's hands and feet. It's terrible, unbearable. But at the same time, the love that held those nails there, the undying love for you and I that kept Jesus on that cross is staggering -- it's beautiful.Bottom line, the movie is quite violent, and I do not recommend that any child under 15 view the movie. But I do think that it is a very important movie, one that can deepen one's understanding of the greatest gift we've been given.25 stars, out of 10.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Punishing, cruel -- and beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1081641600, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2004"}

The focus of this movie is primarily on the 24 hour period of Jesus' life where he is arrested, tried, sentenced to death and crucified.  Flashbacks to events in the gospels and imagined events in his life provide power allusions that help someone who is unfamiliar with Christianity to capture a little more of who Jesus was.I cannot mark this movie down for the blood and gore because that is the direct subject of this event.  Of all the passion scenes or movies I have seen, this one captures more of what I read in the Bible than any other movie.

For those who are having trouble forgiving others, this movie will enable you.  Not because of the movie itself, but the content of the script-much of it comes from the Bible and is itself exceptionally powerful.As far as the technical side of the movie.  The music generally enhances every step of the 'Via Dolorosa', and the slow-motion cut ins are not over done in my view.  They enable you to meditate on what is happening.  It's like our souls have been marinated in the power of what Jesus did.For those who are unfamiliar...the movie takes place on the Passover Feast of the Jews.  This feast celebrates the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt.  Another famous movie, The Ten Commandments, has the scene where the Jews put blood on the doorposts of their homes and the death angel passes over them.  On that night the firstborn of Egypt died, and Pharoah finally let Israel go.  It was memorialized as the Passover Feast.  The actual meal was a hastily prepared lamb (blemish free, year old male).Jesus himself is cast as the Passover Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world, but this is never explicitly stated in the movie.  One must know the meaning of the allusions to Passover and to the 'Death Sentence' of Jesus to understand.For Christians who grasp all of this, it is a deeply moving visual impression that causes many of us to consecrate ourselves freshly to God.  That's always been the effect on my spirit as I have seen this incredible movie.I would not recommend it for children under about the age of 8 or 9 because they cannot understand the real meaning of all these things and it is exceptionally graphic at times.If you have avoided this movie because of the graphic nature of it, I think you ought to sit down and watch it, especially during the Easter season.

Dein \"passafist\"", "helpful": [8, 10], "reviewText": "In my attempt to compose some semblance of thoughts about Mel Gibson's new film THE PASSION OF CHRIST.  I must admit I may ruffle some feathers, and create some heated debate.  Let me be the first to say any condemnation I place on myself first.  Nothing I am about to write is an indictment of any faith other than my own personal self.Religion is such bondage.  Whether you like it or not, religion is as flawed and cumbersome as any belief system. This is why I chose at a very young age to be a follower of Christ, because He came and reformed the broken religions, created and instilled a grace I could never deserve.Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is the kind of movie that restores my faith in the cinema.  It is moving, sick, beautiful, sadistic, and probably the most challenging two hours I ever spent in a theater.  It is the most violent, brutal, honest and powerful film I have ever seen.  It the kind of movie I do not ever want to see again and yet probably will see many times, because it is that terrible to watch, but also so compelling.  I left the film changed and for the first time in my life, something that I thought was so close to me became more crystal clear then ever.  For the first time I saw the true power of cinema and true power of God's ultimate grace.  I would offer that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is one of the greatest and most challenging films I have ever seen (sorry Terry Gilliam, but BRAZIL is my number 2 now).As the film opens we see a short verse from the book of Isaiah, (Anyone whose familiar with the Heavy Metal band STRYPER from 80's will remember this verse well):But He was pierced for our transgressions,He was crushed for our iniquities,the punishment that brought us peacewas upon Him,and by His wounds we are healed.-----Isaiah 53:5(NIV)This passage was written hundreds of years before before Jesus Christ was born.  According to the New Testement, this verse was written to tell of the eventual outcome of the coming Messiah.  It is too bad the high priests of Jesus day were so busy trying to hold onto the religious control of their people that they missed the true Messiah standing in front of them.  In their attempt to keep their grasp on the people, they enlisted the help of one of Jesus' friends.  They arrested Jesus Christ and carted him away, placing Him in front of the high priest Caiaphas.  Then they dragged him in front of the Roman magistrate Pontius Pilate.  In a less than valiant effort to save his own skin and politcal power, Pilate pawns this man he believes to be innocent in front of the garish and ineffective figurehead of a king named Herod.  Herod sends Jesus back in front of Pilate who does everything in his power to save this innocent man.  Alas, he gave the Christ over to the crowd to be scourged and ultimately crucified.The rest of the story involves some of the most realistic and brutal scenes ever put on film.  If you thought SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or SCHINDLER'S LIST was hard to sit through, then you cannot fathom how horrible it is watching Christ get scourged, watching metal rip open his skin.  I honestly thought I could take it.  I was wrong.  Any person who thinks mankind is basically good needs to watch how the Roman guards treat Christ.  The funny thing is, I realize how easy it would be for me to place myself in the story.  How easy it would be for me to follow the crowd and how easy it would be for me to treat this man as badly as the Roman guards treated him.What I loved the most about THE PASSION were the tiny moments when the people who were laughing and scorning Jesus soon realized who they were dealing with.  Some looked on with fear like Barabbas or one of the thieves on the cross.  Others looked on with reverence like the Roman centurion who pierced Jesus' side or Simon, a young man who was thrust into the story to help carry the cross. It is the small moments of reality that hit these people that make me glad that sometimes in chaos, people can rise above.I also found myself in the same boat as Peter.  Here is a man who has followed Jesus to the mountaintops.  He promised to stick by his friend forever, yet when the going gets tough, he shows his cowardice by lying and denying his friend.  To be honest, I shed many tears after this scene.  How many times have I done that to save face?  How would I have felt in Peter's situation? How many times have I have sold out my friends for acceptance and to place myself on a higher wrung?Mel Gibson has done the unthinkable.  He has created a film that not only incredibly moving, but also accessible.  It is hard to try to put the life of Jesus into the context of His death because it seems so pointless.  What did this man do to deserve the pain of the cross? Why do people revere Him so much? Why do so many blindly follow? Mostly, why is a man like Christ worth the fuss?  It is simple. We as humans treated God like a piece of junk and yet He forgave us.  This whole episode was necessary to human existence.The final ten minutes of THE PASSION are both moving and damaging all at the same time.  As Jesus dies the screen goes black for what seems like an eternity.  It was not nearly enough time to compose myself, but what follows is a sweetly lyrical approach to the resurrection that does what it needs to.  So many films leave Christ hanging there, in their own way acknowledging that he may have had a bunch of great ideas, but beyond that, who cares?  Without the resurrection, the crucifixion is an innocent man getting the tar beaten out of him for 45 minutes. With the resurrection, the crucifixion is a story of hope and of grace: something I do not deserve.The cast is phenomenal.  Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern hit the right cords when they have to.  Playing these characters is difficult because there is always a tendency to over and/or underplay them.  They also fill in a canvas that borders on realistic and stylized.  I do not think anyone with even any ounce of compassion could not be moved by the pain of watching Morgenstern (who plays Mother Mary) and Bellucci (as Mary Magdelene) wipe up the blood of Christ.I would love to hear what those who disagree with me have to say.  I would love to hear what those whom have no Christian faith think of this film.  Even if you do disagree, do me a favor.  If your mind and soul are in for a challenging and deeply troubling film, give THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST your attention.  Even if you are unfazed, I promise the film is brilliant, and I have only said that about five films in my lifetime.  You may just leave the theater at least a little changed.  You may have a sense of deep despair or tons of joy, but you will leave with just a tad bit more compassion.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Masterstroke, A True Masterpiece", "unixReviewTime": 1085356800, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2004"}

Many loved them, many hated them.  Regardless, their names were undeniable that year.  \"The Passion of the Christ\", Mel Gibson's directorial follow-up to the Oscar-winning \"Braveheart\" (1995), takes Christianity to a new level.  It stars Jim Caviezel (\"Pay It Forward\") and Monica Bellucci (\"Irreversable\").  This film portrays the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life.  Through the graphic images and the powerful dialect is one of the most unforgettable films of that year and of ever.  This film doesn't play part fiction, part non-fiction; it plays according to to The Bible and other testaments.  This film never holds back on its soul.  Meanwhile, it made film history in many ways.Beyond the controversy is one of the most remarkable films about religion.  Though occassionally some scenes run too slow, and some text is unnecessarily repetitive, its strengths lie upon its ability to tell a story thoroughly.  The emotional aspect never fades from when Jesus is captured to the end.  Through the torture, the blood, the humiliation, and the death, some tears may fall.  Though the conclusion is unquestionable to first-time viewers, the powerful message remains at its peak.  Beyond the last 12 hours of Jesus's life also shares his beliefs and his own faith.  Such written quality was approved by many Christian churches and organizations.  Therefore, this film became the symbol of their religion.The physical aspects of the film are accurate to those from the actual early first century living through the costumes and the sets.  They resemble the pictures from the testaments and history books.  The strong demands for them were met beautifully.  Jesus's physical state during his torture is wonderfully portrayed with make-up.  The blood, the sweat, and bruises add to the powerful standpoint that the film deserves.  Through the work, Jim Caviezel may have been mistaken for the actual Jesus Christ.  Its close graphic images were necessary to include and were wonderfully crafted, proving the level of pain endured.  Such crew-work quality earned this film three Oscar nominations: Best Make-Up, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score.Though all the actors portrayed their characters wonderfully, Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern stand out.  Caviezel's performance as Jesus Christ could not have been done better.  His state of pain in itself, though a few scenes were real, gives new life to this film.  This proved highly difficult since he was in that state of sadness or pain through most of the film.  Morgenstern's portrayal of Mary proved as emotional as Caviezel's.  Though she didn't say much, her facial expressions alone reveal Mary's times, especially witnessing Jesus's torture.Such overall film quality makes \"The Passion of the Christ\" worth watching at least once, Christian or not.  Due to the graphic nature, this is not recommended for children or the faint of heart.  Viewers should use their own discretion.  Few will end this film feeling nothing.  Therefore, this will surely remain commonly talked about to its viewers, even those who dislike it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Most Powerful Film of 2004", "unixReviewTime": 1111708800, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2005"}

Generally, with films like this I prefer to wait a while before evaluating them but I will make an exception here.  First off, one has to admire the risk that Mel Gibson took in even making this film.  He could have contented himself making \"Lethal Weapon\" sequels and \"What Women Want\", films that are high concept and high box-office but have no emotional resonance.  To make this film as brutally realistic and in Latin and Aramaic took a lot of courage.  As for the film itself I found it so powerfully compelling that I saw it three times when it was in the theatres.  The depiction of the crucifixion is brutal for a reason; Gibson wants to show us in no uncertain terms that Jesus suffered for our sins because he loves us and the will of the Father was to save humanity.  There is no blame allotted here; we are all guilty for the sins of humanity.  This film had such resonance for me that sermons that I may have heard in church thousands of times took on extra meaning that was not apparent to me before.  As for the acting, Jim Caviezel is more than adequate in portraying the humanity of Jesus.  He does not so much capture Christ's divinity but that may be more the choice of Gibson's than the actor's.  Overlooked in many reviews is the performance of Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother.  Though given little dialogue, her facial expressions say millions of words particualarly in the scenes where she witnesses the suffering of her son.  Another standout performance here is by Hristo Shopov as the indecisive Pilate.  I would also recommend this film to mature young teenagers despite the graphic nature of the violence here.  There is a difference between violence that is instructive and that which is exploitative.  On a final note, I wish they had included more extras on the DVD release, at least a commentary by Gibson.  Gibson included a commentary on the \"Braveheart\" DVD, which I found to be one of the best of it's kind.  My guess is that they will eventually put the extras on a future deluxe edition of this film, which is a shame, because I do not think Gibson entered into this enterprise as a cynical attempt to make money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Will Gibson's Version Stand the Test of Time?", "unixReviewTime": 1093996800, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2004"}

However, \"TPotC\" is NOT \"The Bible The Movie\", and shouldn't be interpreted according to any particular religious belief or doctrine. This is the main reason why such religious portrayals are viewed as highly controversial accounts, and much becomes muddled or lost when the plot or storyline is overanalyzed as a result. When \"TPotC\" isn't seen or viewed as an accurate account of biblical events, and is seen as a grand display of theatrics involving visually stunning physical scenarios not disguised as works of art, is when it results as a picture worth viewing many times over. And \"TPotC\" contains an exponential degree of props (of both the physical and intellectual variety - which are prime factors contributing to the outcome of this fine, upstanding work of art). In conclusion, one must leave their theological preferences (as well as religious prejudices) at the door, in order for \"TPotC\" to have any real merit of entertainment value (of which there is a high degree). Be warned, as this epic contains graphic images of violence. Language buffs will enjoy the eloquently spoken Hebrew dialects (including the English subtitles).

People are making such a big deal out of this:  the content, all the controversy from the news and people's gossip, Mel Gibson's direction.  I hardly heard about this film until just a few weeks, so I felt like watching this film, cause it looked really interseting to see and know what's the hype about it. I have to say, this movie really is...\"interesting.\"The Passion of the Christ isn't really about the life of Jesus Christ, but just the outcome of him.  It took place in the last 12 hours of Jesus's life in Jerusalem.  One of his desciples, Judas, betrayed Jesus, played by James Caviezel, and was captured by a strong religious group known as Pharisees at the Garden of Olives.  After being accused as a blasphemer to many, Jesus was then chastised to painful whippings, all then leading to the unforgettable, the crucifixion.  During it all, Jesus tries to \"not lead him to temptation, but to deliver him from evil\", ala, Satan.  Also during his torturing, there are some arbitrary-yet-significant back stories that further displays the life of Jesus: being as a carpenter, delivering the message of God to his people, and delivering the last supper of his disciples.  Again, Wow!  Mel Gibson should've renamed this title, The Torture of the Christ, but people say to me that the word \"Passion\" meant \"Suffering\" at a certain degree.  Let me comprehend this: Jesus has gotten spit at, beaten up, whipped, shredded, piercied, and any painful way he went through that not ever the most durable of S&M; freaks can endure...so all that suffering was passion?  Thank You, Mel Gibson, now I don't want any kind of pleasure after this.Wow!  Critics say this movie is graphic, but I didn't expect this movie would be THAT graphic!  The blood, the abuse and torture...excuse me, the \"passion\" that happen to the Son of God for whole 126 minutes, not even all of Nine Inch Nails' uncut music videos I've seen would hold a candle to this movie.  I believe Gibson knew what he was getting into, and that's how he wanted it, so I applaud for him directing this film.  He focused all his past works as an anti-heroic actor, and tries to use it to display the hardship and sorrow of this film, and it made this film work.  The well-done direction gives new perspection on the Son of God.  I see Jesus bleeding, scarred, scabbed, and ostracized, heck, even the Pharisees rather free a murderer than a blasphemer like him, but he knew the future bleeks him, and he would still deliver the words from God to the people.  Even when people around him wanted to see him executed, he loved and forgiving those who has yet to understand God's words.  He would even put his soul in vain to repent for the sins the people created.  It made me realize that it's not the Jews that are responsible for the death of Jesus, but mankind is responsible.  We take our lives for granted, and he sold his life for us knowing that, and I felt like I could've done better with my own life since Jesus risked his \"passionate\" life for people like me to have a better one.The Passion of the Christ has one of the best cinematographies around.  The ways it showed Jesus's suffering in slow-motion, giving it a more dramatic feel, and how the characters expressed about this whole entity.  It's hard to explain in detail about the cinematography of this film, but to put it short, it made the experience felt more real.  For authenticity's sake, the characters speak only in Aramaic language, so whether people like or not, this movie's in subtitles.  If there is one serious flaw this movie has, I think that it just wasn't completely realized.  I may not have read the Holy Bible, but there's gotta be more than just Jesus experience the outcome.  It was suppose to send a message to his people after he died and adore him for his sacrifice, and yet after he died, his soul just walked towards heaven and the movie's over.  That's that, the message that was suppose to deliver in this movie was nonexistant, and it made me suffer, not only emotionally, but somewhat intellectually.This movie really creep me out, but at the same time, I was really involved with it, and I couldn't believe that I was so involved with a biblical film.  The Passion of the Christ isn't everyone's cup of red wine with a side of crackers.  People who're religiously-involved, wanting to know more about Jesus, or just weak-hearted by its graphic content might not enjoy this movie so much.  It doesn't made me change my mind about reading the holy bible as an interest, but it was the best depicition on Jesus's life I've seen since those lousy TV specials.  It may have been controversial to some degree, but people should watch this movie because it's just subliminally engaging.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Passion = Suffering?", "unixReviewTime": 1077667200, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2004"}

But in the actual movie (a film about the voluntary sacrifice of Christ) I found nothing of that sort. Beyond all lesser contexts of tribe, kin or creed, the story contained in PASSION is the far more universal Eternal Drama, that of MAN destroying the best thing that is his, namely the possibility of opening his eyes and seeing change, seeing a way in life to be less violent. We crucify the Truth now today as we always have; with metaphorical stones we continually \"kill\" and suppress people and ideas.Why, in the Drama of Christ did Judas even need to 'betray' Jesus before they crucified him? The authorities could have found Jesus without much trouble, so Judas' action makes no sense except for its symbolic meaning. That meaning is: Christ (through Judas) handed himself over to the baser men who could not see what he was, and (if you review the last supper) Jesus essentially commanded Judas to help him. That is missing in Gibson's presentation, although the spiritual suffering Judas must have willingly undertook to play his role is itself portrayed as a horror for any man to endure. But for what purpose, what result? The crucifixion was necessary, fully intended... and at the moment Christ says \"it is done\" before slouching down on the cross, we realize something has been done TO the men who brought him there, ie. some deep frightening realization of themselves has been touched. This moment is for all of us, and the effect of the event has not gone away.A very thoughtful film overall. We are made to experience the viscerality of Christ's especially fervent subjection to suffering (and why such fervor?) not just through gory makeup and effects, but equally through the depths of psychic pain we see in the faces of Mary his mother, and his devoted Magdelen. I was never so utterly moved contemplating the event of Christ's death. And never so surprised and elated by the event to follow!Just see it.

I have to commend Mel Gibson for his bravery. Even though I am not Christian, I have to admit that this film was well done.I do have to say that it is not easy to watch. I literally felt drained after watching this film and I do believe that this isn't a movie that I am going to watch again anytime soon. This was an experience. That is so rare in filmmaking today. But along side the feeling of draining, I also felt inspired. I was touched deeply by this film. It was amazing what Jesus went through for others.Jim Cavavzel (sp) is brilliant as Jesus. He portrayed both the warmth and the compassion that Jesus had for all people. There was something about his presence. The love that he carried in his big brown eyes. As far as being too European, I found he was more realistic than others. I know he was bloodied and beatened but there was something about him that made me want to be near him.Also as well, I want to point out Rosalinda Celentano's performance as Satan. I found her both frightening but beautiful at the same time. Some of the visuals regarding her deeply disturbed me but I found her fascinating due to the fact she was androgynous. My father could not tell if she was male or female. I'd honestly like to see her in more things.Another thing that captivated me was the way it was shot and the musical score. It was one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in terms of cinematography and setting. It felt so authentic. The music was definately moving.

This was not a film about emotion, brutallity, anti-seminism or the cruelty of Rome.  This was a power packed film about man's relationship to God.  The fact that Mr. Gibson was inspired by his own faith and relationship with God and not emotional content shows the commitment that he has and the courage to tell the story as it was.  The cinematography was excellent, the acting marvelous in light of the weighty subject depicted.  Some have said that this film is not for children or those of a frail mein.  I object and suggest that any child that has reached the age of accountability must see this film so that they can make their own mind up about this event.  The weak or frail that are looking for the moment of ultimate truth must see this film.  If we look at this film and judge it by the same standard that we judged \"King of Kings\" starring Jeffrey Hunter or the \"Bible\" with an all star cast then I believe that we miss the point entirely.  Mel Gibson is the first director in Hollywood that has the intestinal fortitude (guts) to tell the story as it really happened and please note that often those accused of a capital crime did not survive the scouraging in order to be crucified.  God's wrath was not the object of this movie either.  Why would God willing send His own son to a horrifying death in order to redeem mankind and then take it out on the very humanity that that death was planned for before Adam and Eve were even created.  That would be tantamount to murder. There is much debate about the false doctrine of \"Evaloution\" and I submit that this film in all it's cinematic gore and brutallity forces a decision to be made by everyone that sees it.  The fact that Mel Gibson invested 33 million dollars of his own finances into this project shows dedication, sacrifice & commitment.  Don't forget that those that would not support Gibson financially, now wish that they had, since the movie has made approximately 100 times Mel's investment.  Hollywood would rather pervert the Gospels (good news) and portray Jesus Christ as a man with homosexual tendicies than tell the truth, for obvious reasons.  It appeared to me that even the cast of this film was changed by it.  In summary \"The Passion of the Christ\" is the focal point, the pivital point in the relationship between God and man and the attemps throughout the ages of the \"evil one\" Satan formerly Lucifer \"Son of the Morning\" and the chief archangel of God, to thwart God's plan to redeem (buy back) man from sin and bondage to this current world system.  If you miss this point of the film then you reduce the \"Passion\" to entertainment and that diminishes all of humanity.  I don't care if you are a believer of not, the healthy do not need the services of a doctor, but the unhealthy do.  Mel Gibson made a film about a choice between heaven and hell and everyone that sees this film will be held accountable for what they now know are the facts.  The cinematography, look and feel of the sets was tangible and unforgettable.  The acting was very moving and well done.  The wardrobe was very well done and the music was paced right in time with the sequence of events.

Yes, and here is why:  so many times do we see religious films that are, in effect, boring.  They tell the story, making no -- if not hardly -- any attempts at really showing us the pain; the tragedy; the guilt; and, ultimately, the un-dying love and affection.What \"The Passion of the Christ\" doesis allow us to revel in human emotion.  Yes it's violent, but the violence only makes it that much stronger.  With every bone-crunching sound, we feel Jesus's pain.  With every flesh-gouging whip, we share in his torment.  With every ounce of blood he loses, we shed a tear.  And throughout this ordeal, with every bit of faith, strength and unconditional love he produces, we feel him as a human being, and share in his triumph.Jesus was a great man; he \"is\" a great man.  Jesus Christ is the ultimate epitome of love, strength and courage.  No matter what happened, he stuck by what he believed to be true.  And thus, by he end of the film, it is his triumph, not his defeat, that shall be rewarded.  Through his masterful direction, Mel Gibson portrays this in such a beautiful way; so beautiful -- almost Heavenly -- that it simply defies what we had always learned about matters of the heart.\"The Passion of the Christ\" is a beautiful film.  It is also an extremely violent and gory film.  But the violence only underscores the emotion and heartache.  After seeing this movie, I left the theater in awe, practically in dis-belief of everything I had just witnessed (In fact, I could barely speak during the next ten minutes).If not for the huge amount of violence, we would not have had the build-up for what would eventually become a streaming river of human emotion and heart-ache.  It would have been easy for Mel Gibson to lessen the intensity of the violence, but then he would be risking slf-pity; a feeling of self-pity for Jesus.  And in a film such as this, we don't want to pity Jesus.  We want to love him.  To embrace him.  To invite him into our hearts.  And how do we do this?  By feeling what he felt.  By experiencing the injusties carried out against him.  By eventually soaring with him on eagle's wings up to Heaven; up to where there's no pain; no fear; just love.And that's what we should all aspire for; what we should all \"aspire\" to be.  He taught us that love -- great, powerful, un-conditional love -- is the ultimate triumph.  It is the ultimate gift.  That something as awesome as this should not be automatically considered wrong, but rather it should be accepted and celebrated.  That taking in younger children is alright, as long as it's in an innocent fashion.  This is not innapropriate.  It's love.  Pure and Godly love.Thus, \"The Passion of the Christ\" is not only about Jesus.  Thus, \"The Passion of the Christ\" is about society in general and its hang-ups on certain issues.And thus, Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" deserves nothing but the highest praise.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Masterful Epic; Violence Only Underscores the Awesome Beauty", "unixReviewTime": 1092009600, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2004"}

THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, unfortunately, seems to perpetuate division--to re-energize those who fervently believe the gospels, to alienate those who fear the film's message will create a Christian ethnocentric backlash.  There seems to be little common ground, which is a shame, as the movie should be judged solely on its merits.And THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a powerful, gripping, riveting, often disturbing film depicting the last twelve hours of Christ's life.  It is more than obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into this work--yet the symbolism and interpretation winding in and out of the story reveals Gibson's agenda to magnify the suffering and brutality well beyond suspension of disbelief.  His depiction of a surreal, androgynous Satan--a Satan releasing a serpent, a Satan carrying a deformed baby while Christ is being tortured--is not only a departure from the gospels but an artistic gimmick designed to appeal to emotion rather than reason.  And it is reason, rather than emotion, that should be addressed when the subject matter of this film is so volatile.Personally, I don't think the film is anti-Semitic at all; but that is a conclusion best saved for each viewer to draw.  If anything, the movie was anti-Roman; I was amazed at the consistent portrayal of snarling, sadistic, drunken, and nefarious Roman soldiers.  Would it not stand to reason that some of the soldiers--if only a few--would be shocked, disturbed, saddened, or horrified by the events of the day?  Gibson would not have us believe so.James Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci, Ivano Marescotti, and the rest of the cast give spellbinding, powerful performances.  Morgenstern stands out as Mary, mother of Jesus; her facial expressions alone--as her son is savagely and brutally tortured--speak volumes.  I was particularly moved when she ran to assist her son as he fell while carrying the cross; the movie then depicted a flashback of a young Mary coming to the aid of her fallen little boy.  In fact, the flashbacks depicting Christ as a young man and as a prophet were wonderful, but few and far between.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST succeeded in that it made me think, and it made me feel; it disappointed in that I could not help but be distracted by a rather zealous agenda.--D.

At least that is how I experienced it from reading the gospels.  This film was like balm to my thirsty and hungry soul.  The director-financier Mel Gibson wanted to show on camera what the suffering and crucifixion of Christ may have really looked like.  From what I have gathered according to the scriptures and research into what crucifixion does to the body of its victim, Mel Gibson got it pretty close.  Jesus' body after the scourging was just a quivering mass of flesh, the fact that he was able to carry the cross any distance at all was a miracle in itself, due to the massive loss of blood.  What a powerful tool for educational purposes; be it Catholic, Protestant or Jewish.  We need to understand our common past history, not place blame on any one group, but to bring understanding and health to our communities of faith.I have seen the crucifixion in other movies; King of Kings, Jesus, and Jesus of Nazareth to name a few. But the crucifixion scene always felt too clean for me.  It is interesting to note that director Franco Zeffirelli, Jesus of Nazareth, omitted most of the suffering and violence of the crucifixion that Jesus went through because he didn't want to offend the audience.  However without the suffering that is depicted in the Passion of the Christ, Jesus is just or could be an ordinary Holy Man or prophet delivering his message from God.The message that Mel Gibson brings across is that his sin, my sin, and your sin put Jesus on that Cross.  This is portrayed beautifully by the angles of the camera.  To try to make more than this, takes away from the meaning of the passion itself.  During the scourging I could sense the tension and angst of the moment, several times I jumped in my seat. Even though I watched this film twice I still felt the same feelings and emotions the second time around. At times I even felt like I was the one who had swung the whip, or just pounded the nail into Jesus' flesh!  There were so many surreal moments packed into this film, so much so that I actually felt like I was part of the action.  The actors did a marvelous job James Caviezel, as Jesus was the very portrayal of suffering as was, Maia Morgensten, as Mary his mother.Another point that I want to make is that the genre of this film is not easy to put into just one type.  Unlike Gibson's Braveheart, this well done film juxtaposes several types of genre: Drama in the form of the horrific due to the violence portrayed, yet historical in nature. (One just needs to study human nature to see the sadistic qualities of the solders, when allowed to vent their frustrations.)  Educational since the death and resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of the faith of many Christians.  I would not say that this film is entertainment.  The realism and meaning portrayed is much too deep for that.

It's tough to critique this work from a non-religious standpoint - and I am sure the mere existence of a Hollywood-movie must appeal to Christians and religious people in general, as it seems they are finally taken seriously by liberal Hollywood.But let's look at the movie itself; clocking in at what seems to be 3hours plus (in reality, a bit over 2 hours), this movie proved to be very gory, laden with 'effects' (the non CG kind) and, frankly, empty. The movie drags on for most of the time, doing it's job to desensitive you to a gore-fest unseen since the latest Wes Craven flick. You can argue that this story is based on historic truth or is complete fiction - regardless, it borrows from horror movies just as much (if not more) than from much more enjoyable 'bible' movies from Ziffereli's Christ to the old standby Ben Hur. And that's what it comes down to in the end: The movie is pointless unless you want to use it as some evangelical tool. I found it boring and frankly not at all enjoyable (Realizing this is not the happy kind of enjoyment Gibson was going for anyway). ... - the movie's depiction of Jews (who do seem to beg Pilatus for Jesus' murder a lot more than seems plausible, considering he wasn't that nice a guy) is present, but pales in the background of the whole movie. Apart from being more sensitive to Jews, Gibson could have been more sensitive to his poor moviegoers in general.I will say that I applaud Gibson for bringing his 'vision' to screen as he, apparently, intended.

Too bad he didn't leave a lot of room for his actors to act anything besides enduring a record (seemed like 20 minutes to me) flogging scene and other horror fests right out of The Birds or The Exorcist.The movie is bloody, gory, and, to me, devoid of anything new to learn about this person.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Gory, empty and pointless", "unixReviewTime": 1077580800, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2004"}

The opening part of the movie is by far the most interesting and rich in terms of storyline and aesthetic beauty. This part of the movie is what nails it in the two-star range. What ensues, however, is probably the most deplorable attempt at sensory manipulation I have ever witnessed in my life.In a time when neoconservatism and counterfundamentalist-fundamentalism gripped the United States by the jowels this movie made a somewhat fortuitous entrance onto the world stage. As the bells of war sent young American soldiers out on the battlefield to defend Western hegemonic positions by way of \"the Almighty\" (Bush's great justification) this movie danced across movie theater screens and attempted to do much more than tell the story of the life of Jesus. This movie turns Jesus into a symbol of cultural supremacy, a source of endless blood and suffering, and the American flag manifested in human flesh.As I sat and watched the hour and a half of torture unfold before my eyes I looked around the theater to see the faces of the families which so many claim to exemplify \"family values.\" What these children were watching was not a recreation of a myth aimed at reinforcing social solidarity, but a blatant piece of sensory manipulation which aimed at reinforcing xenophobia and notions of cultural superiority.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Violence & Religion", "unixReviewTime": 1088294400, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2004"}

Some such as Forrest Gump, We Were Soldiers, Titanic ... but this extremely violent portrayal of Jesus' crucifixion has brought me to complete utter silence.  It gave me quite an emotional experience.The movie portrays Jesus living his last 12 hours of life on earth, fulfilling God's Purpose for all mankind -- ALL mankind!  Yet sadly, many cultures don't seem to get the picture.  The film clearly illustrates the brutal hell Jesus went through, from sweating drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane to being pertrayed by a kiss, from facing powerful Roman leaders to being spit upon; from enduring non-stop torment of razor-sharp metal on a whip to finally bearing a rough, heavy wooden cross.  I was utterly surprised to notice how many times Jesus had stumbled while bearing that cross, yet I assumed that Jesus was going through utter pain at the same time.  Oh friends, he did this JUST FOR YOU!I have to admit something was telling me that I was going to walk out of this movie stunned, so I had to warn my spritual kin with me that this film was going to contain extreme graphic violence.  I was right all along!  You can't comprehend the intense suffering Jesus went through.  He saw it all along.  He had a ticket to escape from Jerusalem and go on an expedition or something.  He could've left when Pontious Pilate offered him the chance, not once, but many times.  He could've blah blah blah -- but He decided not to.  He knew all along He was called to fulfill the Scripture.I was not surprised to see other movie goers wiping tears from their faces.  I can understand why this movie generated controversy to the media.  But hey, we need something like this in a generation where entertainment is venom-saturated.  You know what I'm talking about.One final summary is that this is without a doubt the greatest film which portrays Jesus' crucifixion.

It is not typical movie \"loosely based on\" anything, which usually means there are some true parts and some fake parts.  This film follows the Bible completely and is therefore a wonderful teaching tool and extremely powerful experience.What I loved most about The Passion, was that it gave me something I'd never had in church.  I've read the Bible, I've paid attention in Sunday School and Church and I know what Jesus did for me when He died so that I might be saved.  On a CEREBRAL level and with my faith, I know it and believe it.  However, this film gave me a solid VISUAL that grabbed my heart and brought it in line with my mind and faith.  Knowing & believing is one thing.  But to see with my own eyes how much Jesus loved me is an experience which I will always cherish.  I believe it will do this for you.Yes, there is a tremendous amount of violence.  And quite frankly, I find it funny that people in THIS country (USA), home of the murderous villians responsible for the almost total genocide of Native Indians and the kidnapping, rape, enslavement and death of Blacks for over 300 years, would have the audacity to pretend they are shocked by the violence of the film.  I attribute this to the hypocritical nature of people in the US who are so desperate to remove GOD from everything (except the money, of course), that they would even dane to complain about violence in a movie; sort of like Mike Tyson complaining about someone pinching him.  What you see in this film is what actually happened.  And you NEED to see that to have a full understanding of what Jesus suffered and WHY.There were sniffles throughout the theatre during the film and I had to grab a tissue or two myself.  However, when the first nail is driven into His hand, that's when I broke down and truly experienced feelings of being completely unworthy of the sacrifice, yet thankful that He was willing to give His life in such a way for me.  This also marked the first time I'd seen a film where NO ONE jumped up at the end.  Everyone sat and had to recover before moving from their seat. Powerful!If nothing else, the film The Passion of the Christ should truly teach you how to forgive.  For, as Jesus was beaten to within an inch of His life, nailed to the cross, hung, bled and prepared to die, He still spoke out \"Father, FORGIVE Them For They Know Not What They Do\".Kinda puts that whole \"she cut me off on the highway and now I want her dead\" thing into perspective, doesn't it?Dr. Braxy :o)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful Is A Soft Word To Describe This One!", "unixReviewTime": 1083196800, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2004"}

I must admit I didn't like it any better this time. I thought that, on second viewing, the movie would just fly by, as so often happens when you resee a film. On the contrary, I found it long and, at one point, I actually started nodding off. (Not during the flogging scene, I can assure you of that. I felt more distant and remote then, less viscerally affected by the violence.)  While I didn't like \"The Passion\" any better, I did come away with a greater understanding of the imagery Gibson uses -- more specifically, its roots in scripture. For instance, I realized that he was portraying Judas as mad -- possessed, in fact -- based on the gospel verse that says, \"The devil entered into him.\" At the beginning, when Jesus steps on the serpent and kills it, that echoes a verse in Genesis: \"He shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for his heel.\" This verse has traditionally been seen as God's promise of a Redeemer for a fallen humanity.  The problem is, how many moviegoers today will be aware of these biblical references -- even Christians? Gibson's film is obviously a testament to his own faith. But he has made the assumption that everybody else shares that belief, and has thus made a film that, in effect, preaches to the converted. What about those who do not believe, or who simply do not know about Jesus? Gibson's \"Passion\" will not reach them because it does not speak, does not even try to speak, their language.  The other problem is that Gibson's version of the death of Christ is a hodge-podge of biblical influences, popular piety and his own idiosyncratic touches. Jesus's trek along the Via Dolorosa reflects, not the gospels, but the Stations of the Cross you find in every Catholic church. Many of the 15 stations portray events not mentioned in the gospels. Again, how many people in the audience will be able to separate fact from fiction?  One final note: \"The Passion\" has been accused of fostering anti-Semitism, yet it tells the story of One who was Himself a Jew. More than that, His death took place against the backdrop of one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, Passover. When Mary says, \"Why is this night different from all other nights?\" she echoes the question asked by the youngest male member of every observant Jewish family on Passover night. And Jesus's Last Supper was a Passover meal. This is hinted at, but not fully brought out in the film.  In short, Gibson takes too much for granted, assumes that his audience shares his knowledge of the Christian faith -- and misses a golden opportunity to explain that faith to others.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Preaching to the converted", "unixReviewTime": 1219968000, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2008"}

Instead, we have a vivid, shocking picture that you won't be able to forget.This is, in essence, a cinematic passion play: We are shown Jesus's (Jim Caviezel) temptation by a surprisingly eerie Satan (Rosalinda Celentano), and his arrest by the Romans. His apostles flee away, leaving his mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern), follower Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) to follow him on the road to where he would be crucified...&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was one of the unexpected hits of the last year -- it had a tiny budget, a seemingly small fanbase, and was made strictly according to the Catholic New Testament. But it struck a chord in people -- not just the subject matter, but the fact that Gibson was so dedicated. Much to Hollywood's surprise, people raced to see the controversial flick.While some accuse Gibson of revelling in the gore, with a little bit of thought his &quot;Passion&quot;'s point comes through. It's horrifying to imagine a person -- let alone an incarnate god -- going through such horrors. But when it is realized what the point of all that suffering was for, it becomes a work of beauty. The biggest problem would be that Gibson spent little time on the idea of Jesus being resurrected, which was the whole point.Jim Caviezel gives a stunning performance as Jesus Christ. Whether it's trying to pray through Satan's prattling or speaking to Mary and John from the cross, Caviezel brings every scene to life. Morgenstern is low-key wonderful as the sorrowful mother who has to watch her son killed by inches. And the beautiful Belucci is equally outstanding as the horrified Magdalene.Yes, it's in Aramaic and Latin. But if the language doesn't hold you back, the beauty of the script can shine through. And Gibson's direction is equally stunning, utilizing rapid camerawork and plenty of flashbacks to make Jesus's struggle even more poignant. At times -- the table scene -- it's more than slightly awkward. But it's easy to forget that by the next scene.It's a shock. It's a controversy. It's a one-of-a-kind film, based on a part of our culture that was underrated by Hollywood.

It has been claimed to include non-stop strong images of graphic violence, and it has been claimed not to show enough of the teachings of Jesus Christ. To me, all of those three things are not in the movie. The films shows nothing about blaming the Jews for the death to Christ, it showed enough violence for us to know how Jesus must how felt, and it showed enough of the teachings of Christ to show how good he was in his life. \"The Passion of The Christ\" was directed by Mel Gibson, and it is not only one of the best films of the year, but it is also one of the most provoking, thoughtfeld film of the year. It is about the final twelve hours of Jesus Christ's life. People claim that the film has too much violence, but if you think about, the final twelve hours of Christ's life was a very violent few hours. Mel Gibson is only trying to show us what Christ went through to save our sins. The movie has beautiful scenery, and I believe it was filmed in Rome. There wasn't that many sets, so most of the film was outdoors in Rome. The emotions were brilliant. The people watching this terrible thing happen to Jesus were either mortified, or glad.When the film starts, Jesus and his disciples just concluded the Last Supper. Jesus is in The Olive Garden, having a talk with Satan and trying to resist the offers of her. But he is betrayed by Judas, who tells Caiphas, and other Jesus priests, where he is located. They arrest him on sight, and Judas gets away with thirty silver pieces. Accused of religious crimes, Caiphas brings Jesus to the Roman Govener Pontius Pilate, because Caiphas wants him excuted, but only the Pilate is able to carry out such an order. Pilate is torn about what to do, but takes his wife's advice to spare Jesus. Pilate lets the people decide who should be freed, Jesus or a criminal. They let the criminal be free, and Pilate allows for a fair punishment for Jesus, but he doesn't want them to kill him. In front of the eyes of his horrified mother, Mary, and Mary Magdalene, they flog Jesus, letting him live, but with hundreds of cuts and scars.Jesus returns to Pilate, and they call for a crucifixion. Pilate does not want this, but he allows it, and Jesus suffers and suffers untill the point where he finally is dead.Jesus was nailed onto a cross, and the film goes through the stations of the cross, as he brings the huge wooden cross to a certain point, but he falls many times, and with the aid of anothor man, his suffering is still great, but a little more easy. The film has to show all of this, but they show enough to make you feel that you were actually there. They did not show the graphic image of every whip hitting his flesh, or they don't show the nails hitting the bone, but they show enough of it. It was really brillant how Mel Gibson was able to direct these people who were great in dipicting Jesus and Mary, and all the other people in the Bible. The story is a very sad one, but it is also very real. It is in Latin with English subtitles, so that made me really feel like I was there, because it was the language that they spoke at that time.\"The Passion of The Christ\" should get many Oscar nominations next year including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Score, Best Adaptated Screenplay, and Best Director, among other awards.

In fact, there may be those eagerly awaiting \"The Passion of the Christ 2: Peter Gets His\". Of course, there is violence in classic art. The Christian iconography of the Renaissance has canvas after canvas of whippings and nailings; but those images are static and stylized, not the graphic naturalism of motion pictures. Speaking of which: Gibson, in promoting the movie, has emphasized how realistic his picture is, an oblique put-down of the Biblical epics of he Fifties and Sixties. Granted, many of those productions were artificial and sometimes not even very entertaining. (At the risk of being hunted down by the NRA, I must admit I think \"Ben Hur\" is about 45 minutes too long.) But the fact is \"The Passion of the Christ\" possesses the same artificialities as those old films -- presenting, for instance, a tall and handsome Jesus. There is a very strong likelihood that the historical Jesus looked more like Woody Allen than Jeffrey Hunter, but Gibson's realism evidently didn't extend into casting. There are also some unfortunate lapses into what can kindly be called poetic license, including a sit-comish flashback where Mary is confused by a modern table constructed by her smart carpenter son.

I like Gibson as a director, Braveheart is one of the best Hollywood Epics ever made, maybe even the best.  His deft touch on emotional chords was admirable, and made for a heartbreaking, tragic, and moving story.  Now, I know his intention here was to show the brutality, the plot was merely an afterthought, but still even the brutality was muted.  It just ISNT that violent, it wisely leaves most of the violence to the imagination, you see the barbed whip, you see its effects once, but most of it is just reaction shots and well placed sounds.  I'm going to go out on a limb and just say the crucifixation of christ is the end of a great story not the story itself, Jesus was a great man who met a brutal end, but it is not for me that the brutality makes it harrowing, it is for what he died.  But say what you want, it wasn't anti-semitic, people who want to see it will, and people who don't won't.  There is obnoxious overpraising and overcriticism on both sides.  The onnoxious Christian side says \"Hollywood\" doesn't like it, where Hollywood is a thinly veiled cynical replacement for Jews.  The obnoxious critising side says Gibson is an insane Holocaust denier anti-semitic and has a parking spot reserved in hell, hardly intelligent criticism.

Never in my life have I been so affected by a film, involved with the characters, awed, and never have I cried so much.  Let it be known that this is coming from a person who does not attend church regularly.  I loved this film not because it was based on the Bible, but because it was a well-made film that had an amazing story of love, sacrifice, courage, and forgiveness.  The whole experience is very spiritual and very personal; there is something in this film that will strike a nerve with everyone who sees it.There are concepts in this film that apply to and can be understood by all of humanity, no matter what your race or creed may be.  Such as the tender mother-son relationship between Mary and Jesus, the pain a mother, Mary, feels when she sees her son suffer, or the concept of sacrificing yourself for a cause so great even you do not understand its full meaning.Aside from the emotional impact of \"The Passion\", this is a great film by \"technical\" standards.  The direction by Mel Gibson is superb and I am so impressed by his passion, drive, and determination, to get this film made.  The acting of James Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, Maia Moregenstern, and the rest of the cast does not even feel like acting, it feels real.  Caviezel, Bellucci, and Morgenstern become Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Mary.  It is easy for the viewer to forget that they are, in fact, watching a film and not witnessing the actual events themselves.  What a movie!  The score by John Debney and the cinematography by Caleb Deschanel are both stunningly beautiful and enhance the film's impact by enormous proportions.The anti-Semitic charges levied against this film are disturbing and upsetting.  In no way, shape, or form does \"The Passion\" promote anti-Semitism.  The only people to walk out of the theater with anti-Semitic feelings are people who already harbor those beliefs.As the story is set in a Jewish land, the people involved in the story are mainly Jewish, some good, some not.  As Roger Ebert said of the characters, \"Each one representing himself, none representing his religion.\"  The actions of Jews in the mob, government, and those in the priesthood do not condemn an entire race.  This film condemns those people themselves and THEIR ACTIONS ALONE.  In addition, Jews amongst the crowd cry out against the torture, the Jewish Simon helps Jesus carry the cross, the Jewish Veronica wipes Jesus' face, Jews in the priesthood are against the crucifixion, and Jesus himself was a Jew.  Most importantly, the Jews did not kill Christ.  No one single person is responsible.  Jesus died by God's will for all of mankind's sins.  We are all responsible for the death of Jesus Christ.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do.\"", "unixReviewTime": 1078617600, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2004"}

Reading through the negative reviews most of it was degrading and rather common place bashing, yet some of the negative reviews raise some important points (And I'm not only referring to the gore here) and some of these do more good than a fanatic review. Yet, as a Christian myself, I know I cannot judge this movie without ever looking at my own belief. I was on the way of becoming an atheist and completely lost my faith in God when my mother got cancer and battled it for years. Yet she, the one who was really suffering, took great comfort from praying, reading the gospels and so on. It was this very disturbing experience (My mother's painful death) that made me think. And then I heard about this upcoming movie... The rest is history.Well, for starters, Jesus HAS lived on this earth and was crucified as several Roman historians and more prove. I encourage everyone to watch the BBC Production of \"Jesus from Nazareth\" for an IMHO historical and rather rational view on the most loved or hated man that ever lived. An great addition would also be the German \"2000 Jahre Christentum\" which can be bought on Amazon.de. Now what happened after Golgotha is up to what you believe or not. But I would never dare to ridicule someone for believing in whatever he chooses because faith is something very personal. That is why reviews that attack those who believe in Christ disturbed me more than the movie. If logic rules the world: Why would those sarcastic atheists even bother to watch a movie on a person they do not respect?As for Antisemitism, I saw none of it. The Romans were portrayed as bloodhounds, not the Jews. And remember, Jesus himself was a Jew. And just because some weren't good people doesn't condemn an entire people, I believe that if we're as smart as some reviewers who cried \"Antisemitism!\" proclaim we are, we should be past that. There are not so good Americans, Austrians, Australians, Chinese as well as not so good Jews. We're all fallible, aren't we? Just as not all the Germans were not has horrific as movies like \"Schindler's List\" or \"Hasenjagd\" portrayed the really evil ones, not ALL the Jews were good or bad either. There are black sheep everywhere. Why does something that common place even have to be explained? The whole movie wouldn't work if ALL the Jews had wanted Jesus to live, just as \"Schindler's List\" wouldn't work if ALL the Germans had opposed Hitler's scheme. (I'm not comparing the holocaust to Jesus' Passion, I'm merely trying to explain why it wouldn't be plausible in another way) What am I saying? Don't regard a movie just as either Black or White. This movie, with all its crude gore, doesn't white-wash anything as much as it doesn't blacken history. It is realistic, painful to watch and made me throw up more than once.It's not entertainment but a reminder of what has been and what has been played down in most versions on Christ's life, esp. \"King of Kings\" and \"The Greatest Story ever told\". An example of \"playing down\" would be how Caesar's murder has been put on film numerous times. Most of these neither follow the historian's GORY descriptions nor do they dare to show what is described in all its gruesome details. The closest version to the actual event as described is the mini-series with Jeremy Sisto as Caesar but even that one is \"easy on the eyes\". Now \"The Passion\" shows that Jesus didn't die as \"beautifully\" as the famous paintings made us think he did. It was gruesome, gory, inhuman, sweaty, dirty, swollen, bloody, ripped... you name it.As for the movie's power: The score alone is enough to go straight to the heart. There are several gems of masterful directing in this movie that I won't ever forget. (Such as the \"Ecce homo!\") Which brings me to the subject of Mel Gibson: Neither the sad fact that Mel's father denies the holocaust (A belief Mel does NOT share and shouldn't be condemned for) nor his personal life or opinions on women's rights or whatever should influence your judgement. What did one NEGATIVE reviewer ask for? An IMPARTIAL view.Now would I ever watch this movie again? No. I cannot bear it. THe experience is unlike any other. It rips you apart, each lash has the power of a stabbing dagger. The gruesome details are too much to stomach. But I'm glad I had the courage to watch it. I'm glad for it as a Christian for this vivid presentation of HIS suffering I have realised that whatever makes me feel \"blue\" is nothing compared to real suffering. Codemn my belief all you like but I cannot disregard this film and its influence in a positive way. HIS message was love. And atheist or Christian, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. This movie's power and controversy cannot be denied, it already has a lot more reviews than classics like \"Gone With The Wind\".

The point of the movie is in the title of the movie: The point of Christ's life was to die for mankind and rise again and thus fulfill the plan of God the Father as laid out in the Scriptures.The means, his beating and crucifixon, was Christ's passion as a diety wanting to demonstrate an unbound love for his creation, even when his human side (our human side) desired to satisfy and protect the self instead.The passion is so well portrayed in this movie that I'm left with a deep awe as to what is such a well known \"story\" and left with the implications of what if it is all true? What if Christ is the true God who came as a man to die and rise again to give us a choice. . .to give us the opporutnity to take our cruel, self-serving ways and now have an avenue to approach a God that is without blemish?What if I choose to grasp the fact that the story of the crucifiction is much more than a historical account of an innocent man receiving the death penalty? What if I truely understand that though things aren't always obvious or visible (as demonstrated with the Satan and demon scenes of the movie) that Jesus was more than a man, that more was at stake in the battle between Good vs. Evil and that fulfilling a destiny at the cost of self is the greatest act of love, mercy, heroism and everything noble that we should all strive to be more like?To watch such a well directed and well acted movie that has the focus of changing lives can't but leave me dumbstruck.

In fact, the only reason I went to see it was because the dialogue would be in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin. I wanted to hear what Jesus' words sounded like in Aramaic.Was I surprised! From the very start, this film was different. I'm a Christian, so I have a bias toward the subject. However, I wasn't expecting the high level of artistry in its treatment, in its filming, lighting, storytelling, and imagery. It felt like a foreign film--that is, sophisticated and daring. This is NOT sword-and-sandal spectacle.From the heavy atmosphere of the Garden of Gethsemane, with its thick mist in blue moonlight, to the Mediterranean light of stone courtyards, and eerie overcast sky above Golgotha, Gibson creates an ancient Jerusalem that seems to surround the viewer. I felt a chill in the garden, almost as if I were there, wrapped in the mist. From here forward, one is pulled along, between moments of frank, intense dialogue to moments of grand mal-dreamlike violence (the arrest of Jesus in the garden) or softness (Jesus' affectionate banter with his mother). The movie throws one off balance, shattering expectations, leaving the viewer disoriented. It was a story I knew well, but Gibson somehow made it new and surprising.There is terrible violence in this film, and there are reasons why people may object to it--especially the scene of Jesus' scourging at the hands of Pilate's soldiers. Usually films leave this sort of thing to the imagination. However, I understand Gibson's decision to dwell so graphically on this stage of the Passion. You can dismiss suffering you don't see. But when it's pushed into your face, you have to face it. I had not realized what \"scourging\" meant until I saw this scene, and it gave me a painful shock of realization that I and my sin were responsible.

People either find this film a masterpiece or completely hate it and dismiss it as an ultra-violent snuff film with no merit. It seems that people's opinions are based on where they stand religously and I can certainly understand that. So I'm not going to add fuel to the fire. I'm simply going to talk about the technical merits of the film and the historical aspects that are covered in this movie. Also I will talk about the transfer to Blu-Ray since this is the film's debut in High Definition.The Passion is without a doubt, a showcase of Mel Gibson's filmaking know-how. He has certainly mastered the art of epic filmaking. Every frame, every scene, is beautifuly concieved. The pacing is pretty flawless and given the fact that the film is mostly spoken in a dead language, it is incredibly easy to follow and understand. A lot of hype surrounded the fact that the film would be done in the now defunct toungue as well as latin but in the end it doesn't matter. This is a visual feast. The subtitles simply confirm that you are understanding the scene at hand. In this film, the visuals and the incrdible score do most of the talking.Historically, the film is pretty accurate. I'm not talking about the Biblical aspects of the film (in that respect, some liberties were taken regarding what is written in the gospels). Whether you believe in the Bible or not is a very personal thing. I'm talking about how the time of 30 AD is portrayed and how the romans dealt with prisioners in that time. The rawness and brutality of the era is very well captured. Whether we can bear watching or not, whether we believe it is too violent for film or not, the fact is that this is how the romans tortured and crucified prisioners in the first century AD. It is brutal and raw. Whether showing that has any cinematic merit, I leave to the viewer.When first popping this BD on my player I got worried. The opening scene in the garden of Getsemani is, by HD standards, horrible. I don't know if it was the \"day for night\" effect that was used or the colors or what but this scene simply did not transfer well to HD. It is very grainy, lacks sharpness and the colors are subdued. I was about to think I had wasted my money when the scene ended and then all changed. After we leave the Garden and head to the other scenes in the film, the film comes to life in HD. Rich, beautiful colors, awsome blacks and great contrast. The textures come out clean and clear right down to the fabric in clothing. The slow-motion scenes (and there are a lot of them in this film)come to life on Blu-Ray. Overall an awsome transfer and one that showcases what High Definition is all about.Very Hard to review this film but if you pass by the religious controversy that surrounds this film, there is a lot here for the fan of filmaking and now for the fan of HD.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Amazing Film and Transfer", "unixReviewTime": 1249776000, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2009"}

Instead of just putting the words of the gospel to be simply acted out Gibson has managed to also put across the intended message behind the words to the viewer as well.  Films of Christ in the past seemed to be shallow and lacking any substance as they seemed to be afraid to go beyond just the superficial reading of the material.  This film is violent and uncompromising because it tells it as it is; crucifixion never was a cake walk and the Romans were extremely brutal conquerors.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual episode was a whole lot more violent than was depicted.  Gibson clearly intended to make it clear that the Passion of Christ was an incredible act of love of God for mankind.  A scene from the film in a flashback when Jesus says that no greater love exists than for a man to lay down his life for the sake of another emphasises this point.  To see the extent of the suffering and painful, humiliating death of an innocent for the sake of those that even hate him is what makes this film so powerfully moving and as a result, this film successfully brings across the true meaning of the word of God to the audience.Christians feeling down or going through a dry spell should stop feeling sorry for themselves and put this dvd on to quickly remove any doubt whatsoever that their God loves them and has given everything, including himself, so that they can be truly free.  Now all we have to do is to exercise our free will wisely; the choice is ours.  The only part that left me a little disappointed is the continuing error of wrongly depicting Mary Magdalene as the sinful woman who was accused of adultery.  If there is a patron saint of mistaken identity or of people who have been framed then Mary Magdalene should be it!  Nowhere in the bible does it say that she is the sinful woman or even the one who bathes Jesus' feet with her tears; all that's said is that she had 7 demons cast out from her.  Hence the scenes of Mary of Magdala's flashbacks took away a bit of the film's impact for me.  Having readThe Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christwhich by the way is a must read if you want a proper accompanying book of the film, I was very pleased to see how accurately this film was in depicting one of the source material from which this film is based.I sincerely hope that this is not Mel Gibson's last attempt at a film based upon the bible and if he does say the Book of Maccabees, we'll get a chance to see how the whole Pharisee sect got it's origins and how based upon this traumatic period of Jewish history the pendulum of extremism swings so radically to the opposite side to the point that it led to the total intolerance and hence the passion of Christ as depicted in this film.  In zealously trying to reclaim \"orthodoxy\" and to move closer to God after the Hellenisation period of Ephiphanes, this new order arose to ironically achieve the opposite by the time of Jesus.  A film based upon the Acts of the Apostles would also be appreciated perhaps based upon Paul's journeys.  There is nothing anti-Jewish about this film given that Jesus and his apostles themselves were Jews; if anything this film is anti-evil, anti-violence and anti-falsehood showing us that peace, love and tolerance is infinitely more preferable.  Mel Gibson proves that he knows how to make movies based upon the intent behind the words of scripture.The picture and sound quality especially in DTS surround format is excellent making this dvd standard format an excellent addition to your video library.  Required regular watching for all adult Christians and comes very highly recommended!Updated: 16 April 2012As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I've appended this update here: the Blu-Ray version of the Definitive Edition of this film is a vast improvement over the standard dvd and is now the optimal version of this film on disc.

He bore the punishment that we all deserve.  He did this because He loves every one of us.  Jesus (who is God) lived a life completely without sin, and served as the perfect sacrifice in order to cancel our debt of sin.  God created us with free will.  While we are all held responsible for our choices, God, in His Perfect love and fairness, held Himself accountable for our ability to act against His will.  In John 15:13, Jesus says: \"Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.\"  In Romans 5:8, the apostle Paul explains: \"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"  What Mel Gibson was trying to capture in this movie is a chilling representation of what our God was willing to endure to make the relationship with humanity right again.  All that He asks for in return is faith and repentance.  We do not deserve such uncommon grace from the One whom we show contempt toward each time we sin.  Salvation is a free gift to all who are willing to accept Christ, and His sacrifice on the cross.  We cannot earn this gift.  This is why it is called GRACE.  A God who was willing to suffer humiliation and an excruciating death, in order to make eternal life with Him possible for everyone, is simply AMAZING!

The graphic violence we find so distasteful was just another day in the Empire 2,000 years ago.  There is no \"sin\" in graphically communicating this truth to modern audiences.One wonders if these detractors would be so critical of a film that portrayed another event, say, the tragic murder of Matthew Shepherd by homicidal monsters, in all its savagery.  It's likely they would hail the \"courage\" of the directors in doing so.

I honestly don't understand how anyone could have a positive spiritual experience from watching this film. I found the violence to be extremely alienating and after awhile it even got a bit tedious. This is just like a big action movie, lots of blood and gore and people fighting and running around screaming. Mel seemed more interested with the violence and blood than he did with the message.

They had segments every now and then of flashbacks, mainly when Jesus saw something it reminded him of something he did in his ministry in the past. I would have liked to have seen more of his ministry as well as his trial and cross.

He is confronted by Satan, who takes the form of a man-woman. A serpent slithers from Satan toward him; Christ crushes it with his foot. Thus begins Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ, a film that has sharply divided both Christians and cinema critics.At moments this is a fine film, indeed an occasionally brilliant one. The cast is excellent; the use of Latin and Aramaic is remarkable; the cinematography exceptional; the production values are first rate. But The Passion is also an extremely inconsistent film that repeatedly undercuts itself through Hollywood flourishes and excessive fiddling with the Gospels on which it is based.In truth, the film says less about the Gospels than it does about the way in which director Gibson reads them. The film is extremely homophobic, first presenting Satan as a multi-sexual entity and then depicting Herod and his entire court as a host of screaming drag queens. The film is also, in my opinion, extremely anti-Semitic--but in a way that many will find hard to pinpoint, for it achieves that tone through the way it is cast and the way various characters are played off each other.What the film isn't is greatly spiritual: with copious amounts of blood, it is more about the hell inflicted on the body than it is about the soul that transcends the torment. And it is here, really, that Gibson most vividly overplays his hand. After a certain point the violence becomes unbelievable, and I found myself wondering more about the special effects than I was actually caught up in the movie.If you've never bothered to learn exactly what sort of horror a crucifixion was, The Passion will certainly enlighten you--and at times it may even move you to tears. But ideally you should read all four Gospels and do a survey of Roman Catholic tradition re the passion before you walk in the door. That way you'll know the difference between text, tradition, and Gibson's inventions.

I was worried enough through that Anna Friel advert. I have to say, though, that the much vaunted violence was mostly hype. I watched the film without flinching. It was tasteful, almost chocolate boxy. Did anyone else giggle when that Jewish guy reluctantly 'volunteered' to help Jesus with his cross? He almost dropped it on him. As if the poor chap hadn't had enough punishment for one day. The only bit that made me react was the Roman telling his men to turn Jesus face down after being nailed to the cross.

Personally, I was more affected by the Book of John than by this movie.  Jesus had a lot of love for people in that movie and you couldn't help but love Him.

Already I was annoyed with \"The Passion of The Christ\".  After walking up and down the rows looking for a decent seat in the dark for about five minutes, I absent-mindedly blurted out a frustrated \"JEEZUS CHRIST!\"  An uncomfortable silence followed.  Heads turned.  Dirty looks were given.  I finally realized what I had done and let out a hearty laugh.  Another great moment for my memoirs, but also the moment that I realized I was in the wrong movie, surrounded by the wrong people.Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of The Christ\", which was formerly \"The Passion of Christ\" and before that \"The Passion\", was made for a very specific audience, the kind of audience that lives and breathes Jesus of Nazareth all day, every day. The kind of people whom have memorized the Bible.  The kind of people that still take offense in this day and age whenever an innocent bystander takes \"The Lord's\" name in vain.  I do not come from that kind of people, and yet, I had still paid for a ticket for this movie.  Why?  Because I had heard it was the most violent film ever made.  My desensitization to movie violence needed a new challenge, and so I went.By the time I had finally made it to see this film, however, my need for gratuitous bloodshed was fading and I walked into the theatre wanting to know more about Jesus Christ.  I have not read the Bible and was yearning to learn something from this movie.  But instead of two hours of education on the life of Jesus and his beliefs, my Friday night consisted of watching two hours of footage of actor Jim Cavaziel getting whipped and falling down in the dirt.  Here's a synopsis of the film: Jesus of Nazareth (Cavaziel) is betrayed by Judas for thirty pieces of silver.  He's beaten, whipped, and torn apart.  Then he's forced to march to his crucifixtion, carrying his own cross.  Jesus stumbles for five minutes, he falls down in the dirt, he gets whipped, he gets back up and the cycle begins again.  This goes on for an hour.  Thirty minutes of this film is Jesus falling down in slow motion.  Then he's crucified.Is this film violent?  Yes.  Should it have been rated NC-17?  Yes.  Were there little kids in the audience who's parents felt it was okay to bring them to this movie because it was about Jesus?  Yes, and it makes me sick because I know--I know--that some of those parents are the same people who protest against violence in film and television.  It makes me even sicker that the theatre was showing trailers for Disney cartoons before the movie started.  Let's soften the kids up before unleashing two hours of senseless violence upon them.  Great marketing scheme.Gibson, who directed and co-wrote the film, made no attempt to educate.  Instead, he set out to depict the last twelve hours of Jesus's life.  In this aspect, he succeeds, but as a storyteller or an educator, he fails.  Gibson brings in characters without any introduction or indication of who they are.  He assumes that everyone already knows what this movie is about.  I felt like I had walked into the middle of the story, although, more accurately, I had walked into the end.  Short flashbacks of other moments in Jesus's life do little to reveal what he so strongly believed in or why he was punished for the sin of man.  What I did learn from this experience is that Jesus was a self-righteous cult leader who died for his beliefs in a time where freedom of thought and religion were not tolerated.  Yes, Jesus was a pompous, egotistical cultist.  This is by no means a criticism of any religion or anyone's beliefs.  It is merely what I observed in this film.  Another observation I made was that Mel Gibson has now become the most pretentious man on Earth.  Him and Jesus deserve each other.I can't argue that the quality of the film is superb.  The cinematography is beautiful, especially in an eerie scene when Judas is attacked by demon-children.  It's a truly frightening scene which brought to mind fond memories of \"The Lord of the Rings\".  In fact, the highlights of the movie all involve Satan, portrayed by a very androgynous actress who's lines were dubbed over with a male's voice.  The film's portrayal of the ultimate evil is exactly what it should be-evil.  My body froze over when Satan walked though the crowd, nursing what seemed at first to be a baby.If the Word of God is \"Watch my son get beaten to death and you will enter Heaven\" I don't need to be hearing it.  This is a horrible movie and shouldn't be viewed by anyone, especially little kids who's parents are too brain dead to realize what they're letting them watch is nothing more than a film documenting gratuitous and realistic torture techniques.GRADE: D or 2 out of 5 stars", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "JEEZUS CHRIST!

He's Christain, I'm Wiccan, We Co-Exist and we like the film.As a film buff, I'd prefer to stick to the story of the film and pay little attention to the disturbing violence (Ex. when Jesus' flesh is ripped, exposing his ribs).  And speaking of which, you haven't seen \"disturbing violence\" until you have seen another Controversial film, Sam Peckinpah's \"Straw Dogs\" with Dustin Hoffman, which didn't rely on gore.When I saw it in the movie theater on Free Movie Night (College Students Only) in 2006, a friend of mine sat next to me and grabbed my arm.  When we were watching the crucifiction and the Roman soldier had to pull Christ's arm out of the socket, I immediately told her to let go.So, living in the bible-belt and going to college there as well, there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the theater let everyone out, except for 4 of us that had walked over from rehearsal for Orpheus Descending.Personally, I still don't think \"The Passion\", while focusing on the last day of the life of Jesus Christ, can compare with the similar retellings like \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" with Max Von Sydow, \"Jesus of Nazareth\" with Robert Powell, the equally controversial \"The Last Temptation Of Christ\" with Willem Dafoe & \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" with Ted Neeley.

The problem is, it's just dramatically inert.  There's no sort of progression or anything; just wham wham wham the power of christ compels you the end--and the violence is so stylized that even the most basic of visceral reactions is precluded.  Further, Jesus in this movie is so obviously an allegory rather than an actual person that it's impossible to feel anything for him.  They might as well be beating on a pinata.  There's a VERY short snippet from the Sermon on the Mount, and a few other flashbacks, but really, who's fooling whom?  These have about the same weight as story segments in a porn film (which this in many ways IS); they're a tedious obligation, and underplayed as much as possible...which may well be a blessing in disguise; while Caviezel is adequate as a meat puppet, he's not so much so when required to actually, you know, act.  The only at all sympathetic, interesting, or indeed human character in the film is Pilate (though the scene with the camp King Herod is one of the movie's few truly amusing moments); however, as far as that goes, you'd probably be better off just reading The Master and Margarita.In many ways, the film's anti-semitism is the least of its problems; however, it is there for anyone who cares to see it.  Physically, the hook-nosed, beady-eyed, conniving Jewish patriarchs embody every Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion-style stereotype in the book (whereas Jesus and the posse are clearly already Christians, in spite of actually being, you know, Jewish themselves), and while the Roman soldiers may be comically sadistic, the Patriarchs are obviously the primary villains here; the solidiers are just their blunt instruments.  It's not necessarily something that's going to leap out at you unless you're really looking to have your prejudices reinforced, but I can see it being pretty unhealthy for anyone on a subliminal level.Granite, there is a fair level of artistry here, even if most of it's wasted.  The opening is atmospheric (though that mood is quickly destroyed when the disciples start busting out the mad ninja skillz on the Roman soldiers), and the creepy androgynous Satan is reasonably cool.  Also...okay, actually, that's about all.  I didn't find the film particularly painful to sit through, but I don't really recommend it either, except in a \"see what everybody's talking about\" way.

Being moved by the images, drama, music, and graphic violence of an R rated movie is different than being moved by the gospel.  I want to go on record as a Christian leader who does not share the enthusiasm.  The film's producer, Mel Gibson, is a devout Roman Catholic, and as a devout Protestant I cannot share his passion for this project, for several reasons:1. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MESSAGEa) A distorted message.Despite its claims about authenticity and accuracy, \"The Passion of the Christ\" does not replicate the gospel accounts, but presents a distorted view of the gospels influenced by Gibson's Roman Catholic background.  Gibson has supplemented the Biblical gospel accounts with source material from the diaries of a Catholic mystic (Anne Catherine Emmerich's \"The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ\")  This is plainly evident in the prominent portrayal of Mary, and the link between the cross and the altar of the mass - important themes peculiar to Roman Catholic theology.  The gospel according to Mel is not the same as the gospel according to Matthew.b) An incomplete message.Secular viewers cannot be expected to understand what they're seeing without a fuller proclamation of the doctrine of sin and salvation.  Little wonder that many non-Christian viewers left the theatre confused.  Is this any surprise?  The Ethiopian eunuch described in Acts 8 had the same reaction when he read about Christ's suffering in Isaiah 53.  When asked \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" he answered \"How can I, unless someone explains it to me?\"  A cinematic version of Christ's suffering is in itself incomplete without the preaching of the gospel and a call to faith.  It shows *how* Jesus died, but not *why* He died.  Without someone explaining it, is it any wonder that unbelieving viewers do not understand what they are seeing?  Instead of leaving the cinema as new converts, many non-Christians left disgusted at the graphic violence (which many attest is worse than they've seen in any secular movies), convinced the movie was more bloody than spiritual, and questioning the credibility of Christians who normally abhor Hollywood's violence.2. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MEDIUMAside from the fact that the movie's doctrinal content is questionable, the whole notion of turning the Bible into film form is seriously suspect. It is not only the message that is influenced by Roman Catholic theology, but also the medium.a) Presenting the gospel in film *can* not be done.A movie about Christ's life inevitably includes significant speculation and fiction, and even the best attempts to be \"authentic\" will ultimately be a distortion of the Bible. What makes Christ's suffering unique is that it was accompanied by a sense of God's wrath and curse which sinners deserve.  A film might attempt to portray the horror of physical suffering and torture, but it cannot do justice to the spiritual aspect of being cursed by God, which the Bible highlights as the most significant aspect of Christ's suffering.  Translating the gospels into film and doing full justice to God's revelation in the Bible is impossible.b) Presenting the gospel in film *may* not be done.Sola Scriptura (by Scripture alone) is a basic Biblical principle defended by Protestant Churches with their roots in the Reformation.  It is echoed in many of their confessional documents, such as Lord's Day 35 of the Heidelberg Catechism in connection with the second commandment: God \"wants His people to be taught not by means of dumb images but by the living preaching of His Word.\" We should not be wiser than God. The means that the Holy Spirit uses to work and strengthen faith is the reading and preaching of God's Word, along with the sacraments. Translating the Bible narratives about Christ into the visual images of film ultimately suggests an insufficiency in the Word and Sacraments, and at bottom tries to cater to man's natural curiosity and dissatisfaction with the written Word! Christians should not be surprised to find themselves curious about how this film presents Christ's life, since sinful hearts are naturally not content with limiting themselves to God's revelation and His official means of grace.  Such fascination is precisely the reason for the appeal of all violations of the second commandment. We must however limit ourselves to the official means of grace that the most wise God has ordained to be the food of our soul: the audible preaching and the visible sacraments.Many Christians who are enthusiastic about this movie may be disappointed at my lack of enthusiasm for a project that purports to honour Christ.  But being Biblical is more than just about getting the message right, it's about getting the medium right too. Noble ambitions do not justify the use of methods that are not pleasing to God.  It's surprising that Protestants would uncritically accept a movie that in principle is the contemporary equivalent of a Roman Catholic stained glass window, a cinematic \"image\" used in addition to the Bible to teach people the gospel.  Is the Bible really so deficient that we need this?  This is an opportunity to renew a passion for the Word - read and preached - which reveals the living Christ. Ultimately only the Bible must shape my understanding of Christ's suffering, the gospel according to Matthew, not the gospel according to Mel.  If you are looking for greater insight into Christ's passion, and if you want your understanding of Jesus Christ to be based on the Bible alone, then my advice is: don't watch the movie, but read the Book! - GODLY GADFLY", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't watch the movie, but read the Book!", "unixReviewTime": 1092787200, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2004"}

Filmed in rich earth tones in Italy, the costumes and large supporting cast of Romans and Jews give enormous variety to what is otherwise a rather extended monotone story.  One can applaudGibson's verismo recreation of the last twelve hours of Jesus' life and like a Good Friday church service the agony of the stations of the cross are orchestrated for powerful emotional effect.  Jim Caviezel is the much beaten and suffering and crucified Jesus, but the events of Jesus' brief thirty-three  years on earth are only slightly suggested.  As with all of the ancillary characters we only are allowed to see only the agony of Mary and Magdalene and the sadomasochism of the Roman soldiers.  Little else is there to take this pageant beyond the blood and gore of the Passion.  And had Gibson been content to leave his vision there, the visceral effect would have been more moving.  Portraying Satan as a morphing female and as deformed, taunting children is over the top and pushes the film into near parody.

Although Christ (Jim Caviezel) is shown to have healing powers, the Jewish leaders see him as a trouble-maker and turn him over to the Roman authorities on contrived charges of treason against Caesar. An oft-told story, it is Gibson's vision to focus on the horrific suffering Christ endured on the day of his crucifixion.Since religion has always been an impassioned issue liable to start wars, the needless controversy surrounding this picture arose before principal shooting had begun. The majority of the film's Jewish characters, caught up in mob mentality, are portrayed as self-righteous and uncaring. The Romans fare worse, with most of them behaving like bloodthirsty boors. Yet, history cannot be rewritten to placate sensitive individuals. If anyone today proclaimed themself a Messiah, would we not condemn him in exactly the same manner?Sadly, the trite screenplay (co-written by Gibson) assumes we know the antagonists' motivation, and barely touches upon Jesus' teachings of love and forgiveness. It chooses instead to glorify the barbaric atrocities of our race in lengthy scenes of blood-drenched torture.As the copper-eyed prophet, the usually engaging Caviezel has little to do but gasp in pain, while the two Marys drift through the draining story in tears. Pontius Pilate is depicted as a reluctant judge and Herod a fop, while the sporadic appearance of a female but deep-voiced Satan seems peculiar and out of place.Gibson also co-produced the film, which was lensed in southern Italy because of its resemblance to ancient Israel. The stained teeth and coarse clothing give the film convincing period detail, but the visuals are drab and without colour. The entire movie is also spoken in the acerbic Aramaic language and accordingly subtitled. This proves to be only mildly distracting -- the rhythmic score and too-frequent sound effects of twittering birds are far more annoying.Like Michael Cimino's infamous Heaven's Gate, The Passion of the Christ will prove to be Gibson's artistic folly. It lacks the beauty and marvel of past biblical epics, offering no entertainment or educational value. Further, there are far too many slow-motion sequences that merely accentuate the slow-moving narrative. If those opposed would simply ignore rather than protest, the film would come and go soon enough. But the curious will carry it for the first few weeks, until interest dies down and this pointless and uninspiring film is laid to rest in a sepulchre.

The excesses of blood and gore and violence remind me of the excesses of the medieval period in representing and imitating the 'passion of Christ.'Theologically and historically, the film is quite accurate (in terms of the Gospel accounts) except for the gory detail of the suffering of Christ.  Unfortunately the Jews are depicted in quite negative terms, which does not help heal the rift between Judaism and Christianity, caused by centuries of Christian demonising of the Jews for killing God.  But the biggest repellant for me is the violence, which seems to suggest we only achieve redemption only through a very bloody human sacrifice to an angry God; something which doesn't seem in accordance with much of the theology I know.While there is no 'easy Jesus' or 'cheap grace', I believe Gibson has gone way overboard in this film with the blood and gore, which tends to obscure rather than show the love of God shown through the sacrifice of Christ.  Indeed, Jesus seems to be in so much pain for half of the time it hardly seems like divine love or the Father's will is on his mind, but sheer agony from the extreme torture.This film is certainly to be avoided for younger children and adults, and anyone watching it should be warned.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Overly violent recounting of the passion", "unixReviewTime": 1163635200, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2006"}

Even more to show graphic detail. And, even more to release it in dead and largely dead languages. But, guts does not make a good movie by itself. Amid all the controversy, there are doubtless people with many positions and emotions, some of which are likely to be incorrect.The film starts in the garden of Gethsemane. All events prior to this point are shown in flashback. Jesus is beaten, scourged and crucified, in graphic detail. I will address different issues:Anti-Semitic: Caiaphas, overall, is not highly sympathetic. He does have a moment or two, but he is largely the one calling for the deed to be finished. The crowds cry out for Jesus' death. But, there are priests that leave the trial of Jesus in protest. There are also sympathetic crowds as Jesus winds down the Via Dolorosa. I do not see it as anti-Semitic, and, IMO, anyone who uses this film to excuse anti-Semitic behavior is an idiot.Romans: I see that Pilate, overall, is a bit too soft to be based on the historical Pilate. He is also conflicted. Overall, the Romans are brutal. I would consider most of this material historically accurate, with some embellishment of details. The Romans are given a far worse hand than the Jews. I wish I saw more conflict in Pilate.Graphic nature: When the flail gets caught during the scourging, it is agonizing to watch. The beating is merciless. The film cuts away during much of the beating, or focus on the face of Christ. I saw it as less violent than I was prepared for, while a friend saw it as worse. It is not a child's movie. I am church going; he is agnostic. It is most likely my feelings about what was going on, as part of my faith, made me wish it was worse so I could truly understand.Original Languages: I am a bit conflicted on this in many levels. First, it was Latin and Aramaic from the English translations. Having taken Latin in high school, I did catch one spot where the English subtitles did not convey the full thought of the Latin. I am not good enough to find others, just the one. I would like to see this film again when I can turn off the subtitles and just watch from a pure spectator position.I am glad that the crucifixion is intercut with the Last Supper. It softens some of the pure violence displayed. You will also notice the stations of the cross, if you have ever been around Catholic doctrine. There are other flashbacks that offer a bit of relief from the story being displayed.The Cinematography is great, as is the acting. The cinematographic style reminds me of a cross between Daviau (Color Purple) and Mathieson (Gladiator). The colors are striking in some scenes and you also get the hyper-reality in others. You forget you are watching a film at times. The fact that the actors are not well known faces may help a lot here.I have two images etched in my mind. The first is Christ saying \"Look, mother, I make all things new.\" The second is His face when right after he states \"It is accomplished.\"Will you like this film? Depends on a lot of things. Christians will likely laud the film, especially Evangelicals. The rest of the world will likely find the film very disturbing and perhaps a bit too violent (as my friend did). It is a harsh film. I think it is rather haunting, whether you are a Christian or not, as it deeply illustrates man's inhumanity to man.The most eerie thing about the film is the complete silence, with the exception of some weeping, when the movie ends. I did not hear anyone speaking until I got out to the parking lot. That, in and of itself, is very powerful.

Christianity has for two millenia treated Jews as responsible for the crucifixion, and utterly rejected Jesus' commandments to Love Thy God with all thy heart, and Love Thy Neigbhour, as well as other important commandments to not embrace Mammon, and not Exalt themselves. The history of Christianity is a history of Hate Thy Neighbour especially the Jewish Ones, and follow Mammon at all costs including the colonization of other nations, the slavery, exploitation and even genocide of their people (eg. the millions of Natives killed in the Americas).How does Gibson's film feed the anti-Jesus practices of Christianity? It focuses on the Church's teachings that Jesus' suffering 'paid' for humanity's sins, so that those who 'believe' in him are 'saved', whereas those who do not, especially the Jews, go to hell. Simply put, Jesus never said or encouraged such absurd notions. On the contrary, he specifically said 'I come NOT to save the world...'. and his parable of the Pharisee and the tax-collector specifically contradicts the arrogance of Christians who imagine they are already 'saved' because they believe in him as the 'universal' Saviour, when he himself contradicted these notions.By focussing morbidly on the beatings, torture, and crucifixion of Jesus, carried out by sadistic Romans, not Jewish priests (who simply wanted him dead), Gibson encourages precisely the wrong teachings of the Church, which Jesus' own statements deny and contradict. No doubt it is based on a sincere effort by Gibson to portray what he has been taught, but those teachings are a distortion of what Jesus himself said.

My long suspicion is that mercy is an aristocratic value. Christianity appeals to this \"aristocracy of the spirit\", which is often a gentler spirit. No wonder that many original Christians and early Christian martyrs were women.  You don't need to be a Christian to feel for Christ's suffering so graphically (perhaps too graphically) depicted in the film. It is violent, not hiding behind pretense. It will be disapproved by the modern Western progressives who believe that the human kind is inherently good. They think only a bad governance or dictators (like Hitler or Stalin) make it bad. Actually, Christ's radical message was the reverse. The human nature is seriously tinted. Special effort is needed to make us love one-another -- not somebody of the same tribe or family - that would be easy, but the enemy. How is it even possible? We are to love all men in spite of the fact they are sinners partially because we know we are sinners ourselves. This message is radically different from the organized systems of self-righteousness embodied in nationalism, religious camps, and political parties. They would not hesitate to crucify Christ again. Christianity never ceased challenging human illusions. The best of it preaches religion of the spirit, other-worldly, preaching charity and humility, trusting Providence and submitting to it, and setting its heart and its treasure in heaven. Whereas other heroes may imagine they can liberate the whole humankind, Christ was more concerned with individual human souls. And there is a question of mercy and the state. Seems to me, mercy is an aristocratic value, it is opposite to the self-righteousness and drive for revenge, which are the things of democratic mob. I'm deeply skeptical about the ability of modern state apparatus to understand its enemy, or even the ally, because the state has already rendered judgement as to the purity of its own intentions. I'd probably have preferred myself a less brutal, slightly more gentle and nuanced film, but I think this one is very good, powerful film.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Christ asserts 'aristocratic' values versus 'democratic' mob", "unixReviewTime": 1381363200, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2013"}

Yes it is well made and well directed, but it reminds me of a really bloody child's tale. Except for the fact that it is so violent, it could easily be a kid's movie. It is so simple; none of the complexities of Jesus' life and statements are examined at all. This movie should just be called \"The Torture of Jesus\". \"Or Jesus got it really, really, really bad.\" Or \"Jesus had a lot of blood, want to see it all?\" Really, think about how SIMPLE this movie was, no ambiguity, no in depth discussion of his teachings and his often (seemingly) contradictory statements. Every statement Jesus makes is non political, and non controversial, except of course for when he says \"those who brought me to you bear the greater sin.\" Meaning of course the Jews bear the greater sin. Other than that we get a very dumbed down version of Jesus and his teachings, \"the wine is my blood, the bread is my flesh, etc.\" No statements from Jesus regarding how hard it is for rich people to get into heaven (paging Mel Gibson, paging Mel Gibson) or how he thought money lenders were bad etc. Would Jesus really want a movie made about him that focused this exclusively and morbidly on his death? Why not do a movie on the life of Jesus? That is much more important than his death, his teachings, wanderings, etc. But that movie would not sell nearly as many tickets as this movie will and that brings us to the truth about this movie and the crux of the matter. This movie is nothing but an excuse for people to watch someone get tortured and rationalize it as a religious, spiritual experience, a vehicle by which an average person can indulge in sadism and write it off as religious education. There is no way this movie would ever be viewed as anything but a big budget torture flick if Jesus were not the one being tortured. Think about it, is that not the only reason it is o.k. For normal people to enjoy this movie, because it is Jesus getting tortured, not someone else? Do people really like this movie so much because it is so spiritual and religious, or because it is so bloody and sick? Honestly, everyone who is reading this knows I am right even if they do not want to admit it, the main attraction here is not Jesus or Christianity, it is torture and blood. I guarantee that if this movie where mostly about Christ's life, and did not focus almost exclusively on his death it would not be nearly as successful. This movie is nothing but a sadomasochistic experience thinly disguised as a religious experience. I saw this movie with a crowd full of glazed eyed fanatics who looked to me like they were getting of on Jesus' treatment, while convincing themselves they were \"getting closer to god\". Please, if anything this movie was Satanic in its meticulous, detailed, and yes, loving attention to each facet of Jesus' torture. If you like watching suffering, you will love this movie! The official Amozon.com reviewer, the always dependably disingenuous establishment intellectual Jeff Shannon, (do us all a favor and retire, PLEASE!!) review differed only from the rest of the wild eyed Gibson's cult's reviews in its sophistication and veneer of objectivity. Mel Gibson was so brave to make this film, oh we should admire his aplomb, his refusal to bow to convention, his spiritual and intellectual independence, I am getting teary eyed just thinking about his pure motives in making this movie! Give me a break! Gibson is a fanatic with an agenda and the money to finance it. However, this is America and just like everyone else he has the right to make any sort of movie he wants, I am no censor, and do not advocate banning this film. That being said, I do not think Gibson deserves admiration simply for being controversial as our intellectual guru Mr. Shannon seems to think, by that standard the KKK would also deserve admiration. He has a right to make this film, but that does not make him brave, just fanatical. Now on to the most important and dangerous part of this movie, the anti-Semitism. This movie is anti-Semitic, perhaps not as much as advertised, but there are defiantly Jewish stereotypes in here. All the Jews that love Jesus are normal looking and nice, all the ones that do not love Jesus are seedy, ugly, scheming, and scum. And for those who think this movie is not anti-Semitic just read some of the reviews written by anti-Semites praising this movie and then tell me I am wrong. Gibson's father has stated that the Holocaust never happened and Gibson supports that statement of his father's. There is nothing intellectually challenging about this movie at all, Jesus got horribly tortured, the Jews were responsible, enjoy the torture while faking disgust, then blame the Jews for everything. Pretty convenient for viewers huh? They do not have to think, they get to be entertained and indulge their unspeakable desires, then get to turn around and blame it all on someone else, thereby displacing the guilt you feel for enjoying this film in the first place.Rich fanatical Christians are buying up blocks of tickets and giving them away for free!!! What other movie in history has had people do that. That alone shows that this movie has a serious agenda. The characters in this movie lack depth and so does the film itself.

Now, I feel ready to write....MAJOR PERFORMANCES:  I think that Jim Caviezel did a pretty fine job as Jesus.  He made the torture and suffering of Christ come to life...conveying the point across as best as he could.  Of course, he had the strongest performance in the film.  However, Mary's (the mother) performance cannot be overlooked.  She did a good job of showing a mother's love for her son....and she brings the \"human side\" of Jesus to the fore.  Others in the film also put in outstanding performances....showing the great political and social upheaval of that period.  The Romans were depicted as people occupying a territory that they didn't really care about.  Gibson chose to show the old Roman glory through Pilate...and the coming decadence (and eventual downfall of the Empire) through Herod.  Whether this is historically accurate could be questioned.  The high priests of the Jewish temple were rightly depicted (in how they acted and their fear/power struggle with Jesus and the disciples)....even though I could see some lending to anti-semitic feeling through their dress and how they were shown as power-hungry political types.  There is a fine line being drawn...it is easy to cross at times....and Gibson tends to straddle it at times throughout the film where it concerns the Jews.THOUGHTS:  Yes, this movie was rather a bloody one.  Yes, some of the scenes (such as the cross being dropped so many different times) are a bit overdrawn at times.  Yes, the supernatural bits (the wolf-thing visiting Judas) were a bit confusing.  However, Gibson has intention in this.  If he made a sugar-coated movie, then no one would talk about it.  His whole intention with this film was to show how Jesus died for our sins in such a horrific way as to make people stop in their tracks and start questioning their beliefs and faith.  To me, if people walked out of the theater and asked at least one question about spirituality, faith, Christianity, Jesus, etc., then Gibson's goal was realized.  And, in that, wasn't this movie ultimately successful?  I think this movie is the closest thing to the real suffering that Christ endured, and I think it will be a long time for it is matched....if ever.I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  However, I would warn people that if they are sensitive to horrific situations, or if they are mulling over questions concerning Jesus in their spiritual life....make sure to bring some tissues and be prepared for a lot of thought and introspection after the lights come back on.  If I was a parent, I would not bring my child to this movie unless they were prepared to handle it.

Speaking Arabic helped me understand almost 80% of the Aramaic dialogue, which sounded eerily familiar and haunting. To me, the movie was mostly about the perennial ingratitude and denial that humanity never failed to afford the Messengers of God. That specific aspect of the film profoundly moved me for that it was depicted so very vividly, and sadly, accurately.Muslims do not believe in Jesus' crucifixion. They believe that he ascended to Heaven in his earthly form before his alleged capture. His betrayer, Judas, was then transformed by God to look like Jesus. Judas (looking like Jesus) was captured and crucified and in turn purifying his soul from the mortal sin of betrayal. Muslims believe in Jesus' miraculous birth yet they don't believe in his divinity, which is one of the major differences between Islam and Christianity.Having said that, the crucifixion scenes were still excruciating and barely bearable to watch. The very fact that human beings were ever capable of devising something so barbaric and inhuman like the crucifixion mechanism or the flogging tools is so unfathomable to me. It's ironic to say that we've come a long way in a time where innocent blood is still getting shed in the most gruesome ways in the name of God.The arrogance and defiance of the High Priests in the film and their determination to eliminate Jesus brought so many allegations that the movie was anti-Semitic. I disagree. I believe that the High Priests at the time of Jesus were so corrupt and venal that they were enraged and defiant in the face of a man claiming to be God's Prophet and wanting to bring about change. Jesus posed a threat to the way the Priests lead their political and religious lives and to the control they had on the lives of those around them. He was a threat that had to be eliminated. Sounds familiar?What many people fail to understand is that Prophets came in times when the majority of people were in dire situations living lives full of deceit, betrayal, corruption, injustice, debauchery and lack of spirituality. Prophets came to bring people back to God and to show them the way of living a joyful life. Prophets were never greeted with cheers and hugs once they started to spread the message of God. They were all persecuted and tortured in one way or another. It's part of our human history and our failure to believe in God's words. I see the movie as a true testament to the ingratitude of all of humanity, not the Jewish Priests or the Jewish people.One of the most mesmerizing portrayals in this film was that of Satan. He was portrayed as a gender-unspecific, haunting character that is almost as beautiful as it is repulsive. It truly captured the essence of evil: a rotten core engulfed by a layer of deceptive beauty.At a time when so many anti-religion films and programs permeate our cultures, this film brings to the forefront a visual of a historical episode of our defiance toward God and his Prophets. It truly pronounces our collective eternal lack of faith in God. To me, that was very sobering, especially now that God and faith are ridiculed and disparaged on daily basis. I guess we haven't changed that much, have we?I recommend this film to adults of all races, religions and cultural backgrounds. Even if you have a different take on the historical accounts of Jesus' life, the film will open your heart to see history from the perspective of one of the world's great religions. It will also urge you to contemplate on the history of the Messengers of God and on God himself.If there is a time for Jesus' return, it has got to be now. Corrupt politicians, fanatic religious authorities, decadent cultures, alienated religions, and imminent self-destruction are all signs of a time humanity is in desperate need for a savior; a savior that will once and for all put an end to the endless feud between religions and cultures and races and souls; a savior that will deliver humanity from itself to a better world where the name of the game is love and empathy for all.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Passion of the Christ: A Muslim&#65533;s Perspective", "unixReviewTime": 1078185600, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2004"}

He wasn't the Roman monster everyone likes to make him out to be (for the simple reason that the Romans followed a Pagan religion - there's prejudice for ya).

One thing has to be said first : this Passion is based on Saint John's Gospel and I have not been able to read that in any paper or magazine. At the same time the film gives many flashbacks that integrates elements from other moments into the story, for example the Last Supper which is not included in Saint John's Passion. The impersonification of the devil is maybe debatable though Gibson avoids any horns and other antics and uses a young character who looks like a man, though he is a woman, so we learn in the cast of the film, and this character is in a way disquieting because he looks very young, handsome and attractive among people who are definitely berserk in many ways. The great value of this film is that Gibson tries to show what this passion really was : sadistic torture and mass-frenzy manipulated by the strong desire from the High Priest, that is to say the dominating group of a theocratic state or government, to get rid of someone who represented a danger for their power. They are only motivated by political selfish reasons and they manipulate the crowd, the people even, the Romans too, into doing what they want them to do and do not have the courage or the authority to do themselves. This aspect is definitely present in  Saint John's Gospel and we cannot say this is antisemitic : this is a criticism of a group of autocratic rulers. The fact that they are Jewish does not change the fact. Criticizing them does not mean that all the Jews are bad and responsible for the crime. What's more, Gibson uses another element that is not present in any Gospel, to know the fact that some members of the Council were against the decision and the procedure, showing that we had a real debate on that issue, though not a democratic debate at all. Gibson is also very moderate on some of the torture and violence because either he does not really show the acts or he avoids some acts that are common place in such a situation. Finally Gibson is trying to show that any society tortures and even kills those they consider as dangers for them and that this happens still today, and even in our own societies, even if torturing is more psychological and economic than physical. The main idea that comes out of this film is that anyone has to fight, to the death if necessary, for what one believes to be true. In other words I will say this film, no matter how gruesome it is and how gruesome it may have been if realism had been the only objective, is a good film, and a film that should be shown to people, particularly young people, who don't seem to know that it is difficult and at times dangerous to defend one's ideas and beliefs.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Passion for our beliefs may lead to death", "unixReviewTime": 1081382400, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2004"}

Adams \"History buff\"", "helpful": [3, 6], "reviewText": "I normally don't write reviews of movies since I don't go to see many of them because they are usually such nonsensical Hollywood crap. But after reading a couple hundred reviews of this DVD, I couldn't resist adding my two cents.I did see the movie when it first came out, and I bought several copies of the DVD for myself and family members because it is truly a transformational piece of artistry and guidance of how to conduct your life for the short time we get to inhabit the planet. Most of the comments I read did not actually deal with the importance of Gibson's contribution to civilization.Jesus was an important contributor to the advancement of civilization because he did something that is so rare in human events. He was willing to die for changing a corrupt world and make it more loving, accepting, and inclusive.  Religion has always been a force for good and evil because it is used by those who want to advance their own agenda rather than that of the originator of a particular religion. This is true whether the focus was worshiping fire, water, cows, snakes, a human individual, and many other idols. Humans are different from our fellow apes because we actually try to understand the unknowable of why we are here, and what we should do in guiding us now that we are capable of more than just sitting around a fire cooking the day's catch.  Muhammad's words are used as an excuse for jihad by lunatics who kill randomly and wantonly to advance their view of the Koran to kill any \"nonbelievers\". The high priests of the temple of David were threatened by a \"blasphemer\" when he pointed out the violation of having money changers in the temple. The high priests in Spain and medieval Europe roasted other \"blasphemers\" in violation of the words of the Christ they supposedly worshiped as their God.What Gibson does with his work is to point out that we all have a choice, actually many choices in life, to choose the path of forgiveness and love of our fellow man, regardless of how they have violated any sense of humanity towards our fellow man, or go the way of Rome at the time of Jesus (or Berlin and Moscow in the 30's and 40's). It is really the only thing that makes us different from our ancestors who climbed down from the trees millions of years ago and moved all over the planet. I find it especially telling that those who watch something like the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and don't feel a need to write a review about such gratuitous violence can give a one star to a movie which is focused on the horrible suffering of scourging and crucifixion two millennia ago of someone who preached honesty, love, compassion, forgiveness, and inclusiveness when the ruling order of the day was sacrificing goats for signs of divine guidance.This is one of the real classics of movie making. It is not for the faint of heart, because dying for the sins of your fellow man is a rare event. No other major religion is based upon such a selfless individual. It is why it has transformed the world from one of Conan the barbarian and his predecessors and successors to one where we think of something other than ourselves and our selfish human passions. Of course humans being humans, the forces of evil are on the march, as exemplified by the suicide bombings in Israel, Ossetia, New York, Washington, Bali, Kenya, Tanzania, Yemen, Germany, etc.Gibson deserves every dime he was rewarded with for reminding us of the transformational nature of the message of Jesus the Jew to mankind. Whether you think of Jesus as the Christ or not, you cannot find a better advocate for all the principles that we take for granted today in the West, including those on the upper West Side or West Hollywood who have never done anything but shoot their mouths off while hundreds of thousands have given their blood and bodies for mankind. Every time I walk among the thousands of crosses in American cemeteries all over Europe, and especially in places like Normandy, where brave young men gave their lives, not for conquest or commercial gain but so that others could be free, I understand their sacrifice and the appropriateness of marking it with the symbol of what Christ did to inspire all of mankind.

Quite frankly, I have no idea what people were looking at when they wholeheartedly claim this movie has no anti-jewish theme. Here are few I found quite objectionable because the biblical account of Jesus's death has been twisted to place the blame of his cruxifiction solely on the Jews.1)Pontius Pilate tries to save Jesus and is portrayed as the good guy. He is not an objective and ruthless Roman governor, but a man who is interested in the truth of Jesus's teachings. Three separate times, he tries to save Jesus's life. First, when the Pharisees and the Jews bring battered Jesus to him , he actually complains that they beat him even though he is yet to be convicted of guilt. Then, refusing to condemn the man, he sends him to Herod. When Herod sends Jesus back (again not finding him guilty), Pilate again tries to save Jesus by giving the Jews a choice to save him. The Jews, of course, chooses to save Barabas instead. Then the Pilate tries to save Jesus AGAIN by just beating and flogging Jesus, hoping it will quell the Jew's anger, the Jews rejects Pilate pleading that Jesus had suffered enough punishment and should be set free. The Jews, and only the Jews, demands Jesus be cruxified.2)The high ranking Pharisees are seen beating Jesus with their bare hands. This scene was utterly ridiculous because it was an equivalent of a Pope beating a Jew with his bare hands(which may have actually happened few hundred years back). Not only is this scene unbiblical, but historically unlikely. The Pharisees were very picky about who and what they touched. A blasphemer was considered unclean and untouchable, especially by pharisees, and beating Jesus with their bare hands broke their own strict rules.I found it disturbing that few twists of the story were all catered to blaming the Jews. In this, I found it even more disturbing than Jesus's death itself.

There are flaws however.  First, this movie portrays a very medieval view of Christ.  Second, the movie captures several unverifiable myths about the death of Christ.  The roles of Pontius Pilate and his wife for instance.  The bible tells us some but the movie goes much farther-probably too far.  However, to create a reasonably complete story I do not see another choice for the author of the movie. Some have said that the movie is only about the physical suffering of Christ but I personally found this to be much less true than I was led to believe by other reviewers.  The emotional torture was greatly apparent to me and also, I believe, to others approaching this movie with an open mind.  I personally am a Christian but I was a little disturbed by some things I saw at the theatre.  Is this a Christian jerk-off movie/snuff movie?  Not in general but it seemed to be for a small minority.  Overall, I believe the movie is appropriate if the people watching understand what they are watching for the movie attempts to portray Jesus dying for our sins.  But, and this is a big but.  No matter how horrible they portray the death of Jesus it just simply cannot be captured on film.  Jesus suffered all the suffering of mankind while he was on the cross and there is just no way to show it.  The other problem which bothered me was that some, despite the R rating and the extreme violence, thought the movie would help their small children understand what Jesus did for them.

Sure he suffered, no one could deny that after watching the film, but so have millions of normal people.  In order to make a good movie about Jesus Christ one must explain WHY he suffered and what the overarching effect of his suffering are, not just show his torture.  Gibson fails to do this, focusing only on the pain Christ suffered and not what he did with his life, which is far more important.  In addition, his direction is very poor, utilizing obscene amounts of slow-motion that would have seemed gratuitous in a sports movie, let alone an epic.  Furthermore, the use of Aramaic and Latin has no real point beyond being pretentious, and the inclusion of Satan is unnecceasary and somehwat off-putting.  A decent film, but could have been done better.So far I have only focused on the film itself, as if it was adapted from a gruesome best-seller and not the bible (although one could argue they're one and the same).  As to the claims of antisemitism, I must say that the Jews are presented in a very negative light, going to all measures to exact awful justice on Jesus while Pontius Pilot is presented very sympathetically.  I would like to say a few things about Jesus and the Jews.1- According to Christianity, Jesus came to earth to die for the sins of mankind.  Therefore, blaming the Jews for his death is contradictory.2- If God is all-powerful and all-knowing, then certainly he could have saved Jesus if he wanted to and didn't because Jesus was supposed to die3- Jesus, in the eyes of the Jews, was a heretic, and the Christians have certianly done their fair share of persecuting heretics.Although to be honest not all the Jewish people are portrayed badly, and knowing Mel Gibson and his father (a Holocaust denier), things could have been much worse.  However, while I am not Jewish, I am sick and tired of people villifying them for the death of Christ, and there was no need to make Pontius Pilot so pious and the Jewish leaders so megamanical.  5/10", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Style but no substance", "unixReviewTime": 1099008000, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2004"}

Rumors had it that the film was anti-Semitic and unbelievably violent. And in what was viewed as sheer lunacy, he was filming it in the languages of the time: Latin and Aramaic. At first I thought Gibson had indeed lost his mind. It sounded as if he were making a pet project that would open and be either ignored or suffer the same fate as \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" a film continually excoriated despite its artistic merits.Yet in the past few months, as more details of the film crept out, I began to wonder if I might not be wrong. After seeing the film and witnessing the response to it, I have to say, I am now a Mel Gibson believer. He's not a madman; he's a genius! And not just for making such a compelling film. No, Gibson is also to be admired for the way he promoted this film and for putting his money where his mouth is as the $30 million film was paid for largely out of his own pocket.And financially the investment has paid off. Despite an \"R\" rating, the film took in $117 million over its opening 5 days, and shows no signs of slowing down. Gibson had difficulty finding a distributor, in fact I think a European company ultimately released it. None of the major studios would touch it, thinking they were brilliantly avoiding going down with a ship they thought was entirely driven by Gibson's ego. And, no doubt, many avoided it because of the religious issues. Before the film had even been screened it was already being attacked for anti-Semitism.Now the heads of those same studios are all probably kicking themselves for not taking it. After all, nothing speaks louder in Hollywood than money.As to the film itself, it's not flawless, but it is brilliantly conceived and executed. It is intense from the start as we witness Jesus struggling emotionally with his coming fate, hoping in some way to now have to face the next 12 hours of excruciating pain and torture. In contrast, it closes with a shot of Jesus resurrected and clearly at peace with himself and the world.What passes in the interim is largely faithful to the Bible, although Gibson did take some liberties. For example, there is no mention of Herod's wife in any of the Gospels, yet in the film she asks as her husband's conscience, asking him to not punish or crucify Jesus. Many have taken the film to task for its portrayal of Herod. Here he is presented as a man tortured by the whole event, seeking a way to avoid having to ultimately condemn Christ. I actually found this quite believable, despite historical reports of Herod's cruelty. And even the Gospels make some reference to Herod attempting to avoid the issue and finally washing his hands of it.The scenes of Judas being emotionally tortured by his betrayal of Christ were a little overboard. I do not think it was necessary to show him literally seeing demons to convey the guilt he must have felt.The flogging of Christ is unflinching and horrifying. If you are a Christian and have never thought of Christ as a physically strong individually, this extended sequence will leave you thinking otherwise. And it is followed by the long, tortured march to the hill where he will ultimately be crucified. Yes it is all bloody and awful, but it conveys all the emotion and pain of what was happening in ways that no previous film ever has. In most films about Christ, his crucifixion is almost portrayed as a relatively painless event, no to so here.You feel every nail being driven in to his flesh and can see the agony in his face and entire body throughout. James Caviezel will probably be ignored at Oscar time nest year, but he is deserving for so magnificently portraying every emotion that one subjected to such torture would have to feel.Most touching to me was the plight of Jesus' mother, Mary. I think how all this must have affected her is often glossed over. That maybe watching Jesus being tortured and ultimate killed was somehow tolerable because she knew he was the Messiah. Not so here and surely not so in reality. Mary is tormented and in pain throughout the ordeal, and the film does an excellent job of driving home the point that while he may have been the Son of God, he was also the son of a very real woman.The film has been criticized also for its very pro-Christian view, and clearly Christians are the intended audience. But it might have been worthwhile to have added a few more sequences that explained who and what Christ was. Gibson essentially drops into the end of a story without any real explanation of what has gone before. I know this was his intention, that he did not set out to tell the story of Christ's life, it just might have made it more palpable and understandable to non-Christians had there been a little more background. As a Christian I had no problem with understanding what had brought Jesus to the events depicted in the film, but I can see where a non-Christian might wonder, \"what is the point of all this?\"The film is violent. But I find it odd that some of the same critics who admire such films as \"Platoon\" and \"Natural Born Killers, \" among many others, would criticize this film for its violence. If violence can ever truly lead to good, it certainly is the case with this film.Yes, it is violent, Yes, it is provocative. But, it is truly an excellent film, one that should not be missed.

Actually, upon seeing it, I have to conclude that the actual problem is the fact that all previous films and plays about the Passion have been much too sanitized and nonviolent. Of course, the violence, apart from being historically accurate, is a reflection of the brutalities of the ancient world in general and the ancient Roman Empire in particular. Those liberals who complain about conservatives selectively condemning televised violence are just being silly. There is a world of difference between the careful depiction of violence in movies and the gratuitous violence that pervades modern movies and TV. Conservatives have never objected to the former, only the latter. Those who complain about the discrepancies in the Gospels are being equally silly. Apart from the fact that these discrepances are to be expected between independent eyewitness accounts, they are minor and easily reconciled with each other (much as variant newspaper accounts of the same event in no way negate the factuality of the event).The violence makes it easy to understand elements of the Passion. For instance, the abject brutality of the scourging makes it easy to understand why many of those flagellated died on the spot. It is amazing that our Lord did not die much sooner. Then again, God the Father needed His Son to live long enough to complete His atoning Sacrifice for our sake.Far from being anti-Semitic or otherwise portraying Jews in a unilaterally negative light, it includes portrayal of Jews as the victims of the Roman conquerors. This is shown by the derogatory remarks towards Jews by Pilate (e. g., This stinking province!...This rabble!...), as well as the Roman soldiers (e. g., An impossible people!...Help Him carry the cross--you Jew!).I disagree with those who say that the movie didn't pay attention to His teachings. Apart from the fact that the movie was about His Passion, and not primarily about His entire life and teachings, it does include substantial references to the latter. These include flashbacks to the time of Jesus as a Boy, Jesus following the trade of His father Joseph as a carpenter, the forgiveness of the adulteress, the command to love one's enemies, the command to love one another as He had loved them, Peter's promise never to betray Him, etc.Because He died to take away my sins, the film enabled me to see myself as His tormentor. It was I who was spitting on Him, scourging Him so savagely, making Him carry the Cross, and then nailing Him to it.The film concludes with a good visual portrayal of His Resurrection. The grave clothes stay wrapped together while His resurrected Body passes right through them, and His Body still contains the nail marks of His Passion. A superb film!

Mel Gibson may have walked his own Via Dolorosa to make this film but the result is not only worth it, it's astonishing!This depiction of the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is perhaps one of the most extreme pieces mainstream cinema ever offered to a public audience, though ironically perhaps, this film would probably have caused much less of a stir among our great-grandparents generation than it has among us.  There is no compromise here, from the first scene as we descend from the clouds into the garden of Gethsemane the viewer becomes a silent observer at the pivot joint of history and is spared absolutely nothing.  This is not a film you watch as much as witness.Much has been made of the level of violence in this film, with one critic going as far as to call it a \"Theatre of sadomasochism\" and another calling it \"The Gospel according to the Marquis De Sade\", but modern cinema contains an absurd level of violence, the body count in the average Schwarzenegger movie makes \"The Passion of the Christ\" look almost mild by comparison.  But what we are accustomed to seeing is violence that has been sanitised for our consumption (or is it delectation?); the truly horrific effect of a bullet or a knife on the human body has been turned into light entertainment or titillation.  I can't help but feel concerned that respected critics feel that it's permissible to feed the public a constant diet of gratuitous violence in what amounts to a moral and ethical vacuum, with no effort being made to show its real effect on the victim, the victim's loved ones and even the perpetrator.Likewise charges of anti-Semitism have been made against this film.  Well what can I say about that?  What once person finds deeply offensive another person may not have a problem with, offense like taste is a most subjective matter and I can only give my opinion.  In my opinion, many of the individual Jews portrayed here such as Simon, Veronica and Mary Magdalene serve to give the film its humanity.  The mob portrayed while on the surface Jewish, seemed to me on a deeper level to represent a cross section of all humanity rather than focusing on any one particular ethnic group, serving at least in part as a warning of the ability of the mob to override the individual's sense of justice and morality.  The overwhelming message being that Jesus willingly gave himself up for the sins of the whole world, which is explicitly stated at the beginning of the film and while a mind already poisoned by hatred and bigotry may take a different meaning, in my opinion I don't feel that \"The Passion of the Christ\" is either deliberately or accidentally anti-Semitic.But whatever one may feel about this film, what nobody can deny is that Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the delicate use of colour and texture serve to make this film a deeply tactile experience.  The acting performances are universally masterful; the score provides the backdrop to the images while never drawing undue attention to itself and Mel Gibson's direction shows all the depth and subtly of the greatest directors.  But really all this is academic; the ultimate test of this film is the reaction of the viewer.  I was deeply moved by \"The Passion of the Christ\" and for me personally the most affecting parts were the almost peripheral events such as the denial of Peter, the total despair of Judas, the torment of Pilate, the compassion of Veronica and Simon and in the end if a work of art moves the viewer on a deep and personal level, what more can it possibly hope to achieve?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A film to stand with the greats", "unixReviewTime": 1080777600, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2004"}

I am not Catholic or Jewish, but a Christian and member of a mainstream denomination with an undergraduate degree in history and a professional postgraduate degree.STYLE: I did not see this movie in a cinema, because I live in a small town without a decent cinema, and because I felt this subject made this film better suited to private viewing. Mel Gibson chose good actors and the film was well-filmed. However, its generally Italian cast reminded me in some ways of the Italian biblical pictures of the late 50s and 60s. I found Mel Gibson's use of the vernacular languages of the time very distracting, and an interferance to understanding a basic story that I was familiar with from my childhood. The language was such a problem that my wife and I changed to \"English narration for the visually impaired\", which was a woman reading the dialog in English and describing the scenes. It helped a lot. The major roles were excellent -- Jesus, Mary Magdalene, but I felt the language kept me from really understanding or identifying with them. Pilate, on the other hand, appeared to be channeling Brando in The Godfather. There was not a real attempt at providing any context for people unfamiliar with the story, which was a great lapse, and there were some significant problems. How much violence was there? It was so over the top, that it made Scarface look like Bambi. There was so much blood, and so much torture that it was impossible to believe that anyone could have lived through it to get to the cross. The film was somewhat dark, cramped, and confusing, so it was at first difficult to be sure who anyone was. Finally, there was an enigmatic resurrection scene totally devoid of emotional resonance and seemingly gratuitously grafted onto the first ending. Color and sound quality of the DVD were excellent.SUBSTANCE -- I understand why some people criticized parts of this movie as anti-Semitic, and I understand why some people said it was \"too Catholic\". The character Satan is so enigmatic I will leave him to someone else to explain his part, and there are CGI transformations of children into demons tormenting Judas. I will have to say that Mel Gibson imagined/created one of the most wondrous scenes I have ever seen, that for me summarized the whole dramatic impact of the subject. At the end of the crucifiction, after Jesus surrenders his spirit and dies, an overhead shot pans back and back, receding obviously into the sky. At the sky level, the scene undergoes a CGI transform into a drop of clear liquid, a tear from God, which when it hits the ground triggers the earthquake. As awesome as this was, the resurrection (final scene) was a brief, minimalist anti-climax that was incredibly disappointing to me, and clearly an afterthought. The burial linens suddenly deflate, and an enigmatic (and tastefully nude) Jesus walks out into the light of day.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not for the faint of heart or stomach", "unixReviewTime": 1096848000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2004"}

Pouliot", "helpful": [18, 29], "reviewText": "Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" spurred intense interest in America in the spring of 2004. The DVD version can only continue the phenomenon.Based on the visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich, a German nun of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, \"The Passion\" fills in the wide narrative gaps in the gospel accounts of Christ's Passion. Emmerich's visions are believed by the very pious to depict, in excruciating and accurate detail, the agonies of Jesus Christ in his last hours. Gibson has stretched and cut Emmerich's visions -- adding an extreme amount of blood, gore and screaming -- to achieve his final effect. Like it or not, this very affecting movie will either awe you (seemingly the majority of viewers) or dismay and upset you (the minority, including this reviewer).The buzz is that this the most authentic depiction of Christ's Passion ever filmed. Actors speak in Latin and Aramaic -- in Gibson's mind, the languages of the time. Neither does Gibson spare the gory details. Roman scourging is said to have been brutal; Gibson shows us each blood-spattering, flesh-rending blow in agonizing detail. The results are visually arresting, serving up searing mental images that will stay with viewers for a lifetime. (PLEASE do not bring kids under 14 to this movie!) Religious authorities have lauded the film. Entire theaters were reserved for church groups. The Holy Father is said to have uttered (falsely, as it turns out) \"It is as it was.\"So what's the problem? \"The Passion\" is a movie curiously dislocated in time. It bears more resemblance to 19th century Roman Catholic peasant piety than to that of secular 21st century Protestant America. As a middle-aged Roman Catholic, I recall how nuns exaggerated and fetishized the details of Christ's Passion. Gibson does the same, lovingly embracing the wood of the Cross; caressing the nails; cherishing the scourges; singing praises to the crown of thorns. I am also boggled by the film's historical inaccuracies. Greek, not Latin, was the *lingua franca* of the Mediterranean world. Having Christ chat with Pilate in Latin was silly. The inscription on the Cross is rendered in Latin and Aramaic only, omitting Greek, against the evidence of the gospels. And if scourging was the standard means for weakening execution victims, why was only Jesus scourged? Dramatically, the movie is propelled only by its unrelenting violence. The acting is perfunctory, the costuming bizarre, the make-up unconvincing and the actors' delivery plodding -- as if...as if... they were carefully pronouncing syllables from dead languages.Gibson's theological statements about the redemptive value of Jesus's death are questionable. Did the Father required an extraordinarily brutal death to atone for a brutal humanity? Or did redemption require the living of an obedient life, as noted throughout the New Testament? Gibson's choice tells us more about him than about God.\"The Passion of Christ\" doesn't add much to the current filmography about the life of Christ. What it does add is highly dubious and often plain wrong. Used cautiously as a devotional aid, \"The Passion\" might help believers to visualize the agony that Christ underwent on our behalf. If asked, though, I'd steer people to the gospels instead", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A Bloody Mess", "unixReviewTime": 1096502400, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2004"}

All the hype, all that I heard, I expected a phenomenal movie.  I never got to see it in theatres- it never came to this country.  Perhaps that had an impact- not seeing it on the big screen.  But I just couldn't empath with what I saw.  To me, it was an interesting portrayal of the death of Jesus by an actor.  I think in large part this was due to the lack of the life of Jesus.  There were only a few flashbacks to alleviate what we saw on the screen- there was little of his life and who he was.  We couldn't see him as a human really- although we certainly saw him as a human in suffering.  In order to relate to a character, we also need to see him or her as a human in times of joy.  Instead, it was near unmitigated bloodshed and carnage.I was impressed by the suffering Jesus had to go through.  It was horrible.  But I was moved to tears only once- when Pilate's wife gave burial cloth to Mary.  This was a human moment; I saw people interacting with each other.  This was missing from the life of Jesus.  Or rather, the life of Jesus was missing.  It was one long death.I wanted more at the end too.  It was definitely a Catholic portrayal, with the focus on the death of Christ rather than the resurrection.  (Of course, Protestants tend to err too much in the other direction.)  The end was too short, too quick- I don't get to see the wonder of resurrection.  But at least there was some resurrection at the end.Also Catholic was the focus on Mary.  This helped bring a more human element into the picture, but it was odd how Mary repeatedly became the inspiration for Jesus in His suffering, rather than God being that inspiration.  There's not even a hint of that in the text.  Also very weird were the bits of demonic elements, looking something like baboons.  And seeing a near-naked Jesus at the end is...unsettling.While there have been many claims of anti-Semitism in this movie, I saw no evidence of this.  It appeared to be what it was- a bunch of Jews and Romans killing a Jew, who had Jewish family and friends.  In fact, it presented far fewer positive portrayals of Romans/Gentiles than do the Gospels.  It is unfortunate that the line \"His blood be upon us and all our children!\" was stricken out of the subtitles, though kept in the Aramaic- it is a moving line, true to the original text and history.  Lest the Gospels are now themselves anti-Semitic...It was enjoyable to hear the original speech.  Though we are still not sure if Jesus spoke Greek or Aramaic on a regular basis, it felt like I was getting closer to the feel of what the Lord actually said.  And, knowing some Arabic, it was fun to catch the occasional word and phrase that I recognized.I do recommend this movie.  It gives a moving portrayal, a different perspective, and a helpful understanding of the actual times and death of Jesus.

No more comfortable crucifixion movie scenes... thank God.The flogging depicted was probably worse than what really happened. As a Shroud of Turin believer, I believe that Jesus was horribly flogged by a flagrum that featured dumb-bell shaped pellets of wood or bone... not a flagrum with sharp metal blades. Christ's entire body was blistered and bleeding, but probably not shredded as it was in this film. It would be hard to believe that anyone would be able to bear a cross... or even WALK... after what this film shows as the scourging.As an artistic depiction, however, the overdone scourging depicts how it must had felt for our savior... the agony.As for whether the film is anti-semitic or not, simply read the account written by the Roman- Jewish historian, Josephus. Josephus writes of a Jewish prophet that came after Christ, who preached the downfall of the Temple. The SANHEDRIN arrested him, and turned him over to the Roman Governor. He was scourged by the Roman Governor and set free... and the angry Sanhedrin wasn't very pleased. A stealth assassin ended up killing this prophet of doom with a stone.Thus, Josephus confirms that the Jewish government of that generation  would turn a fellow Jew over to the gentiles, if such a brethern dared to oppose them in any way.As the final closer to this controversy, Jesus said that \"no man\" could take his life... only he could lie it down for us. Thus, the \"Jews\" didn't kill Jesus... the \"Romans\" didn't kill Jesus... JESUS willingly died for our sake.Mel humanizes the Lord in a special way... and the scenes between Christ and his mother are especially stirring.

Jesus was betrayed by Judas and handed over to his enemies, who condemn him and sentence him to die.  He is brought before Pontus Pilate, who has Jesus bound and flogged.  The flogging scenes are some of the most graphic of the movie.  Finally, Pontus Pilate agrees to turn Jesus over for Crucifixion.The Crucifixion is one of the most moving and powerful segments of the movie.  Seeing Jesus crying and asking God to forgive his captors literally brought tears to my eyes.  Jesus also promised salvation to one of the thieves, also crucified, who repented of his sins.  Jesus' death was marked by a darkening of the world, and when one of the soldiers was told to pierce Jesus' side to make sure he was dead, blood and water poured from the wound.  Jesus was finally taken down from the cross on Good Friday and laid to rest in the tomb, but he was resurrected three days later on Easter Sunday.This is one of the most powerful and awe-inspiring films I've ever seen.  Director Mel Gibson does a remarkable job describing the last hours of Jesus' life and the scenes, especially the flogging, cross-bearing, and Crucifixion, are some that I'll never forget.

Elmquist \"Moviephile\"", "helpful": [9, 14], "reviewText": "In a powerful rapture of graphic storytelling, Mel Gibson's vision of Christ's last hours on earth is shocking, disturbing and strangely uplifting in some ways.  Shot in remote locations that are very similar to the harsh countryside of the supposed location of the crucifixion, the movie looks authentic with just a bit of Hollywood drama.The Passion is a tough movie to watch.  It pains you with brutal scenes of torture inflicted on Christ as he is persecuted for his claims of being the King of the Jews and the Son of God.  The anti-Semitic allegations really aren't warranted.  I mean, c'mon, if he hadn't been accused of being a Blasphemer, then he would not have sacrificed himself.  The high priests feared the coming of Jesus because it meant that he could tell the people the truth, truth that they didn't want people to know.  They didn't want a mad man to fill the people's heads with fantasy, nor did they want to true son of God to make them realize what was really happening.  In short, they would lose their place and stature as religious leaders.  THAT is simply human nature.  If Christ showed up today I have no doubt many Christians would doubt his authenticity.  I don't think God faults us for our weaknesses and fears, so I don't believe in the end the religious leaders would suffer divine persecution.Back to the movie though, it is not just a religious revival of the death of Jesus.  It is a story, one that many people already know so a lot of structural detail is left out.  Mel Gibson instead focuses on interesting aspects, mostly in flashbacks, that you may not expect, particularly the mother and son relationship between Jesus and Mary.  With such heavy influence on Mary and her struggle with watching her son's death, this is definitely a Catholic's perspective (Gibson is a devout Catholic).  But there is nothing wrong with this, it adds a very emotional impact.  The lack of focus on Mary Magdelan is strange though.  The one scene that flashes back to her stoning and Christ rescuing her from that torture is short and actually puts Christ in a heroic light.  Once again, nothing wrong with this.  It gives him a strong presence as if to say `anything that happens to him happens because he wishes it to happen'.  One very good dramatic element is the struggle of Pontius Pilate to not have Christ killed.  It is one of the best character conflictions of the story.  Pilate tries very hard to keep this man, who may simply be delusional, from being convicted by a very angry crowd.  He doesn't want an uprising, but he doesn't want to kill someone out of the crowd's sheer hate.  His final decision to release an insane and homicidal criminal is a last ditch effort to avoid the inevitable.  Other than displaying beyond human endurance, there isn't much in the way of performance that Jim Caviezel can do.  But he still plays the part well where he can.  There is an especially good scene with his mother where he is displaying his skills as a carpenter, showing us how he must have spent most of his life making a living.  The opening scene in the garden has him begging his father to not have to go through with the sacrifice, a very human reaction.  Lucifer stands close by trying to convince him that one man cannot save the entire human race.  The action of killing the snake released by Lucifer is extremely symbolic and again puts Christ in a heroes light.The production value of this movie is very good.  The cinematography is stark and realistic, but again a bit Hollywood.  Being forced to read the translations can be tiring, I think some line did not have to be translated and the point could have been understood.  Kudos should be given all around to the actors for learning what they had to of the dead Aramaic language.  The CGI effects are very good, blended seamlessly with Jim Caviezel as he is whipped with an array of weapons.  It adds a tension building element that makes you cringe and has you telling the purveyors of the beating to stop.  One might even question if Christ could have remained conscious throughout the experience, being that he was in human form.  But that is potentially a much greater argument.  With all the hype that led up to this movie, I expected it to be more graphic.  But as an avid movie goer, I didn't find it any worse then some horror movies.  But it was more realistic obviously as to what would happen to a man if these atrocities were inflicted on him.  Thankfully Mel adds a resurrection scene at the end to lighten the darkness, I wish this scene had been a little longer.  I highly recommend the movie, not only as a powerful tragedy, but as an emotional drama that can affect anyone, no matter what religion, if they watch it for what it is; a man who sacrifices himself for the greater good of humanity.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A painful story", "unixReviewTime": 1104364800, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2004"}

His performance was worth an Oscar. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of being Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera; you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. The makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and \"the passion\" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs.

I was stunned to find a vast majority of the audience staring at the blank screen in stony, nervous silence. Many of these individuals had journeyed to the theater on a chilly Wednesday evening in the hopes of viewing a faith-affirming and reverential retelling of Jesus Christ's final 12 hours on Earth (as recorded in the Gospels). Others can come to determine if the film was as gruesomely violent and virulently anti-Semitic as many critics and religious leaders had proclaimed. Every person in the room was waiting doggedly to be either moved and heartened by Gibson's spiritual ecstasy or revolted by the brutality and prejudice of a cinematic travesty. It was clear to me immediately that I was dealing with a movie so provocative and polarizing that it could frighten and compel an audience of people who had not even seen it yet. Now, with the release of the movie on DVD imminent, I feel it is prudent to reflect on this unique and controversial piece of cinema in a calm and rational manner. You are entitled disagree with some of my opinions (I admit to not being a Christian, but I have tremendous respect for all religions and a strong belief in God), but I beg you to hear me out and reserve any final judgments until you have finished this review.The film I watched was sometimes as beautiful and moving as the devout among us had hoped, but often as harsh and nasty and the cynics in the audience had feared. This is without a doubt one of the most unrelentingly violent movies ever produced, with enough vicious beatings and flowing blood to make The Silence of the Lambs and Natural Born Killers look like Disney films. In the hands of his Roman tormenters, Jesus is chained to a post and whipped with powerful sticks and a cat-of-nine-tails with hooks until almost every inch of his body is covered in cuts and sours. He is spit on, slapped, punched and pummeled more times than any person could hope to count. When Jesus is nailed to the cross near the film's conclusion, the audience gets to see the dull nails obliterate his flesh and hear his bones cracked by the additional beatings of the Roman soldiers. I deeply respect Gibson's desire to portray the suffering Jesus endured in an honest manner, but after a couple of hours such displays of violence come across sickening and gratuitous. I was so desensitized and disheartened by these violent acts that I was unable to find inspiration in Jesus' bravery and perseverance in the face of danger. The abundance of violence also prevented me from gaining a greater understanding of Jesus' philosophy of tolerance, devotion and brotherhood. There is precious little screen time devoted to Jesus' teachings and sermons, and these sequences (usually presented as flashbacks) are often stilted and unconvincing. Still, I should note that many people that I love and respect have found the violence in this film to be appropriate and moving, so perhaps I would have to become a Christian to truly appreciate and understand it.Although the Romans are depicted as Christ's most prominent oppressors, he is also tormented and abused by the prominent rabbi Caiphus and his counsel of high Jewish priests. Since many people are reluctant to see this movie because of the alleged anti-Semitism it contains, I feel I should discuss this issue at length for the benefit of potential DVD buyers. Caiphus is presented as a bloodthirsty and unsympathetic tyrant who demands that Jesus be crucified for having the audacity to claim that he is the Messiah. He turns Jesus over to the Romans without a second thought and later brings an angry throng of Jews before a ridiculously weak-willed Pontius Pilate to loudly demand the death of Jesus. Pilate is deeply conflicted about murdering a man that he can find no series fault with, but he ultimately relents to the will of the high priest and orders Jesus crucified. These cartoonish images of Jewish villainy have led many to dismiss the film as anti-Semitic garbage, and they certainly damage the historical credibility of the movie (however, since Gibson was only concerned about being faithful to the Gospels, which are personal accounts that are not neccessarily as historically consistent or politically correct as some would like, maybe this isn't a fair complaint). However, many historians believe that Caiphus and the other Jewish priests were reluctant to turn Jesus over to the Roman authorities, but did so to prevent Jesus from cultivating a following big enough to bring down the wrath of the hostile Roman Empire on the entire Jewish population. Additionally, Pontius Pilate was, by all accounts, a cruel an inflexible ruler who hardly needed the encouragement or permission of a powerless minority group to execute a troublemaker.Gibson may have exaggerated the wrongdoings of some Jewish individuals, but he also presents several positive and heroic Jewish figures. The character Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus bear his cross when he is too weak to perform the task himself, and movingly risks his own life to defend Christ from further Roman abuse. Other Jews chastise Caiphus for his intolerance towards Jesus and wail with grief when they see Jesus' mangled body being dragged through the streets by the Romans. Ultimately, I don't think this film can be truly described as Anti-Semitic. It presents a wide range of Jewish characters that act in accordance with their personal beliefs and are not representative of the religious group as a whole. Fear of anti-Semitism is not a valid reason to avoid this movie!Thus far, I have primarily focused on the aspects of this film that disturbed me. I must make it clear that The Passion of the Christ is not a film without numerous merits. Gibson is a gifted filmmaker, and many of his visual and dramatic devices are dramatically riveting. I was particularly impressed with the depiction of the devil as a shrouded, voyeuristic woman, the use of a raindrop as the starting point of a stunning earthquake, and a brightly lit resurrection sequence that left much of the audience beaming. The performances are universally superb (particularly the passionate and emotionally vivid turns by Jim Caviezal as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern as the Virgin Mary), and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography perfectly captures the agony and the ecstasy of this momentous tail.I almost regret having to give this movie a star grade. The Passion is simply too complex and polarizing to be accessed so easily. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to gain a greater understanding of Christian history or simply put the controversy surrounding this film into perspective.

Now, sixteen years later, Mel Gibson comes under similar scrutiny, but though it is easy to draw comparisons between the two cases, it's the differences that shed the most light on \"The Passion of the Christ\".  First of all, Gibson's take is faithful to the source material in the extreme, which is completely the opposite of what got Scorsese into trouble.  The controversy over \"The Passion...\" isn't whether it's blasphemous -- I don't think I've heard a single person claim that it is -- but whether the visceral depiction of Christ's sufferings were gratuitous or necessary to get the point across.  The purpose of this review is solely to examine this central question, as I believe it's crucial to whether or not this is a great film or merely a good one.  Hopefully, by the time I'm done, I'll have elucidated myself with enough detail that you'll be able to tell without seeing the film whether you agree or disagree, and if the latter, whether you would have a contrary opinion of the film's quality as well.First of all, I hold true that - in fact - the mere depiction of Jesus' torture in graphically realistic terms is NOT an end in and of itself.  To claim the opposite to me would be to give credence to the type of people who stand outside state capitols hoisting posters of mangled fetuses -- whether you're for or against abortion, in other words, your decision should be based on sound ethical arguments and not how gruesome the surgical procedure itself actually is.  Similarly, it would be the utmost of shallowness to base one's faith in Christ in feeling sorry for the guy for the physical pain he went through.  This almost seems common sensically obvious once stated as such, but one can never belie the sway a good \"tear jerker\" has over the emotions of it's audience.  So with the above conjectures laid out, it seems that we must by necessity rule out the value of the film based solely on the historical authenticity of it's depiction.  But what else does it have to offer if authenticity will not suffice?Honestly, the authenticity seems to be where Gibson is laying most of his cards, although \"The Passion...\" is far from the droll sterility of, say, \"The Alamo\", to use another historically authentic (yet dramatically static) example.  Jim Caviezel as Christ does everything you could ask out of him given the demands of the script:  he's assertive, secure in his beliefs, and displays a certain kind of humanity, although Gibson's treatment of Christ in this respect demands a different kind of humanity than Scorsese wrought out of Willem Defoe.  This Christ is not unsure of his heritage and his mission, only his ability to withstand the physical consequences he will have to endure.  And, true to his mission, Gibson certainly puts Caviezal's Christ through the wringer.  In fact, even if you're willing to accept that the concept of historic authenticity is riveting in and of it's own right, it's hard not to feel that Gibson may be going a little overboard here.  By the time Jesus is finished being put through his scourging, it's already become hard to believe that a human being could withstand as much punishment and continue to live.  Even if he'd suddenly been pardoned before the Crucifixion, in other words, it's impossible to believe that a mortal man could have healed from the wounds inflicted during the scourging, and without this dramatic element the journey to the Cross cannot help but be an anti-climax by comparison.Ultimately, I think even the most devout Christians would have to agree that the compelling story of Christ is not by what abuse of the flesh he met his demise, but by what persecution and theological uncertainty he lived his life up until then.  Without that there would be no story of Christ to pass down over the millenia, as history reveals that Christ was not by any means unique in the extremes of his physical torment, torture being a fairly commonplace device up until very recent times (and with the sketchy revelations of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, who's to say even now this is the case?).  By this measure I'd have to give the nod to Scorsese's film, historically inaccurate or no, as at least it goes to some lengths to try and understand what a born mortal would have to come to grips with given Christ's pedigree.Ultimately, \"The Passion of the Christ\" tells us next to nothing about Christ's mission on Earth -- someone who had by some means escaped any previous mention of Christianity would certainly not be able to piece together it's tenets based on what they have to go on here -- which leaves nothing else to judge but the merits of a blow-by-blow orgy of violence against the alleged Messiah.  In brief segments, Jesus is shown in flashbacks preaching to his flock, but these segments are short and fragmentary, not so much underlining what it is that Jesus was sacrificing himself for as contrasting the \"good old days\" when he was flying underneath the political radar, free from the later tyrannical fallout of the dominant religious groups, and as these scenes in their brevity and the sense of their editing fail to provide the film with a dualistic message, we must once again fall back on the central thesis that historical vivacity is an end in it's own right.

I'm just mentioning the movies he directed not including the movies he starred in, I could go on forever with those movies. Anyway I have to admit I was blown away on how realistic the Passion was.  Everything is accurate right down to the nitty gritty. Sure it is graphic but were talking thousands of years ago, people were ruthless back then. There are no tricks or twists, Mel Gibson keeps it very organized and gets to the point. The music and acting is stunning I give much respect to Jim Caveizel he did a great job along with his mother Mary and Pontius Pilot. At first I was hesitate of the Hebrew subtitles, but Mel Gibson does a great job of keeping the dialogue very simple. Also The strong emotional scenes kind of speaks for itself so I guess you really don't need much dialogue. I am also glad how Mel Gibson basically screwed Hollywood, I mean obviously he wasn't going to win any Academy Awards because of the subject matter not to mention like 80% of Hollywood is Jewish. but since this movie  was going to bring an anti-semitic wave which it DIDN'T I might add it couldn't get one academy award, Ridiculous! But it is great to see this master piece gross over 700 Million dollars, he basically shut the academy awards up with that. Besides that, the dvd is great too, although no special features are included which I'm not surprised at either, the movie speaks for itself. I personally would rather have a better quality movie with no special feaures than a 4-disc set with an awful picture. The quality is amazing though. This movie probably is one the highest quality looking movies ever. The sound which is in DTS. 5.1 hebrew aramic surround sound is stunning, all of my speakers get attention.

The controversy surrounding this picture was immense, Hollywood was outraged but helpless to stop the film's release due mainly to the heavy audience pull and box office power of Mel Gibson(who also wrote,directed and starred in the violent smash-hit Braveheart). Movie-goers were intrigued by the growing controversy as well as Gibson's sudden, and intense faith-based statements. This film was most successful amongst protestant Christians here in the US, Entire churches bought out showings all over the country and helped to push the already controversy-driven box office gross past the $300 million mark.

I myself thought it was mostly &quot;realistic,&quot; though of course none of us were there when these things happened (the fact that Jesus lived is beyond debate) and therefore cannot judge if the events are entirely &quot;accurate.&quot; It is certainly is hard to judge this film if one includes religious bias. Technically, the film was very well done and gets bonus points for the Aramaic and Roman dialogues. The details were well-studied and reflective of Palestine under Roman rule. The classes of people were accurately represented. The setting was nearly perfect, because I've been to Jerusalem and cannot tell that the film was shot hundreds of miles away in Italy (perhaps owing to the Roman influence in both places?). The script is extremely close to the words of the Bible, though some parts remained somewhat inconsistent (such as the order of Jesus' words in certain scenarios).On the sentimental side, Gibson should not be judged for his execution, because he wanted it to be accurate. If someone finds fault with his direct approach, then I guess that person is blaming the Bible. Some people were offended that Jesus didn't run for his life, saying that this is entirely unrealistic and unChristian-like. However, the Bible says exactly that: that Jesus had several opportunities to free himself and not even go to Jerusalem in the first place. This is one example of Gibson's steadfastness to the &quot;original&quot; script, and I believe that had he altered things to make them more sensible, the movie would have suffered a lot.On the whole, a movie you'll want to watch just out of curiosity.

His choice of doing this movie in Latin and Aramaic was correct; it would not be nearly as powerful if performed in English. Jim Clavizel has little match with the intensity that his eyes convey. Gibson also adds nuances and flourishes to the story (the Satan character and the demons that hound Judas) that add so much to this movie.A lot has been written concerning the anti-semitism this movie conveys, and I'd strongly recommend that you see the movie and reserve your opinions on that until you've actually seen the movie. I don't really blame the Jews for the crucifiction, and I think Gibson utilizes the mob as a tool of Satan, and that really shows in the movie.

I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn't sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, \"The Passion of the Christ\" is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is.\"The Passion,\" as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson's finest work (he had previously directed \"Bravehart\" and \"The Man Without a Face,\" two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that's how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way that passion could never be conveyed.Every frame of Gibson's work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as \"The Natural\" and \"The Patriot.\" To further Mel's perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney's score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.As a film reviewer, it's not my job to do what I really don't want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn't, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that's all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let's think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people you put in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that's anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there's enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that's all I have to say about that.Bottom line, it's not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn't a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and \"the passion\" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs.

The film begins in the Garden of Getheseme where Jesus is betrayed by Judas for thirty pieces of silver.  It ends with the crucifixion at Calvary.  The bulk of the film is what happens in between Getheseme and Calvary and it focuses on Jesus' suffering.  This is what sets \"The Passion of the Christ\" apart from every other film made about the life of Jesus.  Many deal with the life of Christ, and others with his teaching.  \"The Passion of the Christ\" deals with one very short, and particular, period in his life: those last hours, the Passion.  The American Heritage Dictionary includes as one of the definitions of \"passion\" as \"The sufferings of Jesus in the period following the Last Supper and including the Crucifixion, as related in the New Testament\", and that is exactly what this film is about.  This is Mel Gibson showing us what Jesus went through and at times I could almost hear Gibson saying \"This.  He went through this for us.\"While \"The Passion of the Christ\" is a very brutal movie, and perhaps half of the film features in some way the beating that Jesus took on the way to Calvary, it isn't the violence that has stuck with me after the movie ended.  What I found particularly memorable were some of the smaller moments: the flashbacks that showed Jesus with his mother (Maia Morgenstern), Jesus teaching, Jesus with the apostles.  Just as memorable, though, were the moments of betrayal: the look between Peter (Francesco De Vito) and Jesus after Peter denied Jesus for the third time, Mary (the mother) and Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) together weeping at the torture Jesus is suffering, and any time we saw Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) moving through the crowd, or tempting Jesus.  Lastly, Mel Gibson's handling of the Resurrection was particularly moving.  It is a mix between beautiful and simply powerful moments that allow this movie to rise far above what could otherwise be called (and has been) nothing more than two hours of Jesus being beaten.What makes reviewing this movie a challenge is that it is very difficult to separate the story from the filmmaking.  As a Christian, the story is one that is very familiar to me and is also one that I personally believe in.  As a reviewer, I have questions about Mel Gibson's storytelling.  If I knew nothing about Jesus of Nazareth and was not familiar with the story of Easter Week, would I understand what is happening in \"The Passion of the Christ\"?  The film lets us know that this is a man named Jesus who is being persecuted, that it is the Jewish Pharisees of Jerusalem which have brought charges against Jesus to the Romans, and they feel that he is blaspheming God.  For this they wish Jesus to be put to death.  What the film does not go into is why.  Are these Jewish leaders just blood thirsty?  Are they threatened by Jesus' teaching?  Is there a serious law that he has, in fact, broken?  Why are they pushing so hard for his death?  \"The Passion of the Christ\" does not answer these questions.  Someone who does not know the story of Jesus may not know why he is being brutalized to this extent and what promises Jesus' life and death, and resurrection bring.Viewing the film from my perspective, the lack of that detail being in the film did not affect what I think of it.  \"The Passion of the Christ\" is a bold, moving, powerful film and the fact that the subject of the film is so central to what I believe only makes it more so.  I cannot speak to what a non-Christian would feel about \"The Passion of the Christ\" because an emotional response is so personal and subjective, and that emotional response is exactly what \"The Passion of the Christ\" taps in to.  The combination of how skillfully Mel Gibson has crafted his film (excepting that little issue with exposition) and the emotional response that it encourages, this is arguably one of the best films of the year so far and may very well be a contender for Best Picture come Oscar Season.The one criticism that I would like to address here is the charge, of some, of anti-Semitism.  It is one that I do not understand.  At the beginning of the film, when Satan is tempting Jesus, Satan mentions that carrying the full burden of sin is too much for one man.  The suggestion is that Jesus (and therefore God) is choosing to do this, and that Jesus knows what is coming.  In fact, Jesus says as much in the flashbacks throughout the movie.  Moreover, while it is true that it is the Jews who turn Jesus over to the Romans, there were some Jews who spoke up against their leadership saying this was wrong.  It was also only in the power of the Romans to condemn Jesus to be crucified and the film shows Pilate symbolically \"wash his hands\" of the whole affair, which was a cop-out.  Pilate made the decision.  It is also the Romans who are brutally whipping Jesus as punishment before he is to take up his cross.  The implication here is not that the Jews nor the Romans who are specifically guilty, but rather: All are guilty.  All.  With Gibson's hand being the one that drives the nail into Jesus, he includes himself in the \"all.\"-Joe Sherry", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "impossible to separate story from the filmmaking", "unixReviewTime": 1094515200, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2004"}

I weep to think that this would happen to the most guilty of men let alone a good man who's done nothing to deserve it.  And though I am not a Christian I respect the story of Jesus.  But, this is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen portraying his life.99% of the story, the dialog, and the violence is not an accurate portrayal.  It's not just that most of the story is made up or isn't accurate according to the Bible, but most of the dialog is made up too.  Most of what is supposed to be from the Gospels is altered in some way to say something other that what scripture says.The violence in itself is another story.  Though it is told that Jesus was tortured and suffered, the violence depicted in the movie just isn't realistic.  It's not just that 99% of it isn't mentioned in the Bible, but there is no way on Earth that Jesus could have survived 20 minutes into the movie.  If he hadn't bled to death first, the fishhook type whips used on him would not only have ripped his flesh off his body, but gone in and ripped out his internal organs too.  It's just not realistic.  No one could have survived that.  Not even the Son of God.The portrayal of the Roman soldiers that beat Jesus wasn't realistic either.  I know that the Roman soldiers were cruel and could be sadistic but the way they are portrayed in this film is as much over the top as all the violence.  The Bible mentions nothing of all this punishment.  He wasn't beaten and whipped and kicked around the way they showed as he carried his cross to Calvary.  He fell three (3) times.  And most of the portrayal that went on with him being nailed to the cross and set up isn't mentioned at all.  Him being flipped over the way he was.  Geez!What this movie blatantly is, is an attempt to play on the emotions of those who believe so deeply in the story of Jesus.  Period.  It's false propaganda and it plays its part well.  You can tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they'd ever seen.  Don't buy into it.Any Christian who is interested in watching a more accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus would be far better off watching Jesus of Nazareth.  Or any non-Christian who's just interested in learning about Jesus' life.  The real purpose of Jesus' life is portrayed in Jesus of Nazareth, and done very well.  His teachings.

Frederick", "helpful": [411, 465], "reviewText": "One of the most talked about films in decades; thought I would add my 2 cents as a late entry.I think the root controversy about the film has to do with the question of whether or not it has artistic merit for a viewer without faith. I think this is a fair question, as I never really understood the idea that religion offers, so to speak, an excuse for ugly artwork. Arguably there is no such excuse, unless one of the points of religious art is to repel people who don't already share the faith.The film has been labeled violent, which it is; but unfair here has been the label that it is in some noteworthy sense exceptionally violent. It is not. There are hundreds of films that are far more violent--and graphic. Perhaps this film is even less violent than average, at least of more recent decades. It is perhaps even less violent than the blockbuster version of Gandhi of some years back, billing Candice Bergen and Ben Kingsley, of which the Passion has reminded me somewhat; at any rate they are at least in the same ball park. Rather, the distinctive mark of the Passion is that it invites us to keep the humanity of the victim of violence in full view; not to distance ourselves by, say, feeling contempt or anger towards the victim as a bump-off-able bad guy, or seeing the victim as a replaceable curiosity, a dispensable nitwit. In the Gandhi movie, for example, the majority of the acts of violence are against victims who are more or less, cinematically speaking, dispensable nitwits. All we see Gandhi suffer is being shot at the end--and even that, at the beginning also, setting up a flashback--and a few blows to the head (from which he recovers).  In any event, it is easy to name films that are more violent, just not ones that, at the same time, are as personal.The character to suffer the violence in this film is not only the main character, it is a character who is anything but a dispensable nitwit. He is unambiguously portrayed as is in the Gospels--a perfect human being--and more: a Divine Person. No doubt faith is helpful here, but if the viewer can so much as entertain the premise as a possibility, then I would say that the movie is as beautiful as it is emotionally powerful. Yet even apart from that premise, the film also powerfully portrays deep love and friendships between human beings, which has surely a beauty of its own even under heart wrenching circumstances. Moreover, in what is surely one of, if not the most violent sequences in the film--the scourging (the soldiers carrying out the order, one in particular, wind up going over the top in enthusiasm)--we only see the victim about half the time; the rest of the time we see shots of peoples' faces, notably his friends, mostly of the face of his mother. The film does show us the anatomical side of the violence enough so that we really understand what is happening--but no more; the point is what it MEANS for it to be happening. In this film suffering is given a human face.It is quite a unique experience. First, breaking out of the package of being \"mere cinema,\" there are two points of honesty of the film even apart from any faith claim. (1) by all serious accounts, Jesus of Nazareth was at the least an exceptional human being; yet death by crucifixion was no walk in the park. (2) by all serious reflections, in one way or another--regardless of how you slice it (whether from the point of view of any religion or from the point of view of atheism)--humanity really hasn't treated God any better than the main character gets treated in this film. This is a film which portrays God as staying with humanity despite the way it has treated him (and the way human beings have treated each other). The violence is not for it own sake; still less is it for the sake either of sadism--or of a narrator stepping off the screen to address the audience with guilt trips (shaming and flagellating the viewer)--; it is for the sake of thoughtfully presenting this possibility in an artistic way. Second, rather that allowing the audience the space to distance themselves from characters undergoing violence, this film actually does the opposite: it prods the audience to see NONE of the characters as dispensable nitwits, not even those who are committing the violence. The anti-Semitism charge is simply a non-sequitur. It's not anti-anybody.The film visually portrays what I have described without being artificial or saccharine, invoking a remarkable depth for symbolism and a good sense of timing; it plainly succeeds in telling a story blending sight and sound. I will give two examples which I found especially powerful; they are even related. One is where the film shifts back and forth from shots of the feet of the roman soldiers standing in pools of his blood as they scourge him, to shots of the feet of the Apostles as he was symbolically washing them. The other is a subtle, nonverbal portrayal of the conversion of a roman soldier which spans in a sense the entire film. This conversion story is visually framed from the film's opening scenes when a servant of the High Priest (Malchus), accompanying the cohort sent to arrest Jesus, has his ear miraculously restored after it is sliced off in a struggle by one of the Apostles. Malchus remains for some time on his knees, as if so overcome by the experience he cannot move. The roman solider to be converted (referred to as Cassius) is subtly introduced in the next scenes (he is one of the soldiers Mary Magdalene complains to about the arrest), but we see him from time to time throughout the movie, witnessing and being influenced by various events; in a final scene, blood and water falls upon his eyes, flowing from the side of the deceased victim that he pierces with a lance (though first non-verbally apologizing to the mother; he does it merely to confirm he is dead), and he falls to his knees in a way which resonates with the action of Malchus.  Malchus, so to speak, had his hearing restored; the Cassius, so to speak, his sight. (While restoring Malchus' ear, Jesus says that he who lives by the sword, shall die by the sword; in response to Cassius' sword, Jesus, in death, gives life.)  On the side of deep friendships, notable are the relationships between Jesus, his mother, Mary Magdalene and the youngest Apostle, John. One moment uniting this dimension to the above examples is when John stumbles and falls on his knees before the two Marys (running to them to tell them of Jesus' arrest)--to be followed by John later seeing Mary's agony as she watches her son fall to his knees as he carries the cross. Another, also depicting the bond between Jesus and his mother, is when Jesus is actually underground (after his arrest), and Mary, intuiting the spot, kneels and puts her ear to the ground (with John and Magdalene watching and moved with understanding).  The kneeling image in general is itself also framed by beautiful opening and closing scenes invoking a folding together of earth and sky (the first providing the backdrop of Jesus falling to his knees in his agony in the garden; the second entailing powerful from-the-ground-up and from-the-sky-down shots of the moment of his death on the cross). Here resonating throughout is the film's awesome musical score. I would add that the use of Aramaic in the film punctuated with subtitles was nothing less than masterful; I am not even aware of the film being in a \"foreign language.\"Acting was good but special mention needs to go to Maia Morgenstern, who played the mother. In interviews she said she played the character from the point of view of a mother who loved her son; the result is one of the most moving and beautiful character portrayals in all of cinema.If you are looking for popcorn-eating entertainment, this is not the film to watch. (Even during gladiatorial times at the Colosseum this movie would have gotten thumbs down.)

We had decided to make this an evangelism event with a discussion following the movie followed by a chili fellowship. A group of 50 (half guests of Salem) attended the afternoon matinee. Flyers announcing the discussion were distributed and several viewers joined us for the discussion. All in all it was a good afternoon and all involved were able to sort out thoughts and feelings following the watching of this movie.In a word, the movie was breathtaking. Some scenes the audience literally jumps. The theater was quiet-one didn't hear the munching of popcorn!Artistically the movie portrayed the suffering as no one has seen it portrayed before. Many at the discussion admitted that it got to a point where they said to themselves, \"Enough already!\" One person even left the movie (but did re-join us for the discussion). My advice is to know yourself. If you feel you cannot handle violence or blood, don't go. If you do desire to see it, consider waiting until the movie is released on video or DVD and rent it-you can always stop the tape if the action becomes too intense.Mr. Gibson remained for the most part close to the Gospels. There are some Catholic add-ons, such as I believe Veronica wiping Jesus' face which is not found in the Gospels but is part of the chronology of the Stations of the Cross. Some thought Mary may have played too prominent a role, but she was the mother of Jesus; what mother wouldn't be there to comfort her child?Amazingly, I was able to understand about half the spoken dialogue (all that Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic training finally came in handy). The scenes with Pontius Pilate were interesting. Sometimes the dialogue between Pilate and the Jewish leaders was in Latin, other times in Aramaic/Hebrew. I will try to watch it again to try and detect a pattern. The subtitles were somewhat close to the Scriptures. Not knowing what translation of the English Scriptures Mr. Gibson used I cannot verify if the passages were verbatim. I did enjoy the opening scene of a black background with a verse from Isaiah in white text. It set the tone for the movie.There was, indeed, violence. How can there not be when a man is whipped and then crucified? Here the movie did disappoint. Having studied the Roman methods of torture and crucifixion I believe Mel Gibson held back in this area. And this might be the right call. The horrific violence that was on the screen was too much for some. Add to that the fact that the mental and emotional suffering Jesus endured weren't portrayed. (If you can stay awake through it, watch The Last Temptation of Christ and keep in mind throughout that this was a temptation as envisioned by the artist. This might give you a taste of what Jesus endured internally in this suffering.) The scene at the cross was a tad short. Mr. Gibson could have had Jesus pushing himself up gulping for breath just to give the audience a taste of the cruel discomfort on the cross. The arm being pulled did add realism to the effect just before the nail being driven through the right hand.The role of Pilate brings a new dimension for Christians who haven't thought too much about this man whom they name in their confessions. Mel Gibson adds a soliloquy by Pilate on truth where he asserts what he believes to be truth as he sees it. His wife, Claudia (not named in Scripture) does play a more prominent role than she does in Scripture. In the Gospels we are told she sends a messenger to her husband; in Passion she is right there through the trial giving her husband disapproving looks.You will not soon lose the picture of the gleeful Romans whipping Jesus. Again, in our discussion it was pointed out that the Roman culture loved blood.All in all, this is not a movie you will enjoy (even if the ticket taker says, \"Thank you. Enjoy the movie.\"). But you will leave thinking about it and pondering it. You will want to talk to someone about it. If you do go to see it, try to go with a group planning to discuss it afterward, or schedule time for reflection afterward. One patron we met took a flyer disappointed she had to go to work.

It is beautifully set and filmed, and very well acted. The  Aramaic dialogue lent authenticity and beauty to the scenes. I, personally, did not find the film to convey a message of anti-Semitism.So, why only two stars? Partly because I'm a stickler for a well-written script, and this film not only didn't have one, it hardly required one. But mostly because, though I am not a believer, I have respect for the story, and a desire to see it told well. Gibson's peculiar obsession with violence overwhelms it. Pelikan's Jesus Through the Centuries points out that, while we think of Jesus as being a challenge to dominant cultures, the portrayals of him are often a reflection and an endorsement of the dominant culture. So, in our extravagantly, pornographically violent times, Gibson produces a movie that extracts the most violent 24 hours of Jesus' life and makes it stand in place of the whole story. In an age of religiously-inspired violence, it is a tragic decision for a director to make.Gibson presumes that everyone knows Jesus and is sympathetic toward him. While that may be mostly true, it also lets Gibson off easy, absolving him of the director's difficult role in a tragedy: make the audience care for the characters, tell the audience why these characters are worthy. Instead, he involves us in an orgy of gore, reveling in the blood spilled, and raising the awkward question: If this is the whole purpose of Jesus' life, then what are we to think of the \"villains\", Judas and Pilate, et al, who brought about that which must be done?But Gibson as storyteller/evangelist is not interested in conundrums. I think he wants to make us feel good about feeling so bad. And he fails, at least in my case. I want to be ennobled by this story, as by stories of other selfless teachers who fell to the authorities of their times. I was appalled by the parents who had taken their children to see it. It is, hands down, one of the most graphically violent movies you will ever see, and parents should exercise the same caution with this film as they would with any other portrayal of a death by torture.I knew that it was violent, and graphic, when I went to see it. What I hoped for was that Gibson would try to convey a sense of solidarity between Jesus and others who have been murdered, tortured, or persecuted. That sense was entirely missing. If he had run the quotation - \"Whatsoever you do to the least of these, you do unto me\" - toward the end, all of the violence might have been somewhat redeemed by urging us to treat others with the same pathos Gibson wants to evoke in us for Christ. Instead, he gives the resurrection a bare moment at the end, accompanied by military marching music, as if Jesus came back to kick some serious [...] in retribution. I found the film, and its violence, utterly lacking in redemptive value. There is no grace here. I am not surprised that Gibson followed it up with yet another portrayal of human sacrifice, since that is what he reduced this grand story to: a mere barbaric bloodletting.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good news . . . and bad news", "unixReviewTime": 1184457600, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2007"}

The Gospel story is filled with understatements and \"Good Friday\" is one of them. It is also a name for a day which on the surface of it was the antithesis of anything good - the politically motivated murder of an innocent man through envy, ambition, connivance, and betrayal. But Good Friday is, as all Christians know, the day God Incarnate gave his human life to save humanity. So like the seventh day of Creation, \"it was very good\". The Passion of the Christ was the central, seminal, pivotal, event in Western Civilization.I personally have never been able to make it through an entire sitting of this film. It's too horrible, too deeply disturbing, to watch, for me. That said, I've made sure to watch it in sections from start to finish for it truly is a magnificent film, a film that needed to be made. It's a film that stands as a testament against the powers that be today similarly as its subject was a testament against the powers that be. Unlike so many films made today - for example the recent Noah, or the Lord of the Rings films by Peter Jackson - this is not a film that had to mangle its subject to make room for the director's ego. Rather, this film delivers as accurate a portrayal of the Passion of the Christ as this world will likely ever see in cinema. The stories surrounding the making of the film are fascinating in themselves.Why watch this incredibly disturbing film? It's sublime. Schopenhauer's definition of the sublime in Art, as I recall it being described, was of a force too great to be contained by the three-dimensional forms of time and space moving into the present, an aesthetic experience that is beyond moral judgments of right and wrong that touches the spiritual \"third rail\" of Creation. Similarly, James Joyce wrote of what he called \"aesthetic arrest\", an aesthetic experience in which one is neither drawn by desire nor repulsed by fear but simply locked into a profound meditative assessment of truth. These ideas are my best approach at answering the question of why to watch this film. There is something cosmic about this film. The miraculousness of the Passion narrative communicates itself through this film. So yes, hard as it is for me to bear watching it, I cannot imagine going through this life without seeing it, several times, for unless one is a mystic or saint this is the closest one will ever come in this lifetime to witnessing the Passion of the Christ.

The furious anger of the crowds against Jesus is bizarre and frightening, but never explained, so it is represented as pure blood lust.As a purely political movie, one might say this film shows that when the awful power of the state is combined with the enthusiasms of the mob, true evil will be done.All that said, this movie is a depiction, not a drama, and watching it, you are a witness, not an audience, and, as a witness, at times you feel very uncomfortable with the way the violence is being presented. There is an unmistakeable love for blood in this film, and it is an open question whether it reinforces or undermines the message.  The only interesting character is Pontius Pilate, who struggles with his conscience (embodied on screen by his wife), but ultimately \"washes his hands\" of Christ to appease the angry mob.Gibson is still a man of Hollywood, and the movie does have a brilliant Hollywood ending; a brief image of Christ healed and resurrected, but bearing one very visible mark of his torments.  This image embodies the new covenant represented by Christ.  But its power probably depends on how much faith you have in Christ's divinity.  If you are like me, thinking of Christ as a great teacher, but not \"God on earth\" the blood and suffering will seem over the top.

Davis", "helpful": [8, 10], "reviewText": "I have been scanning the reviews and I think that most of the reviewers can be pretty easily segregated into two extreme stereotypes: the Christians who naively think that watching this movie will transform the worldview of every viewer into an instant convert--which as a fellow Christian I find to be rather insulting of common sense--and the other extreme of non-Christians who had no idea what to expect from this movie other than what they should never have expected in the first place: an entertaining Hollywood flick.Make no mistake about it, the love of Christ is a love that disturbs. This is a very distrubing, non-entertaining movie, which is exactly what it was supposed to be.I give the film four stars instead of five for two reasons.1) It was marketed to Christians (good) but it was marketed as a mainstream theater flick (bad) in hopes that the casual observers would convert. I do not blame Mel for this directly, nor the filmmaking company. This was the fault of naive churches that embarrassed themselves by buying out theaters and harrassed strangers at the theater entrances. Mel did market to these churches directly, so there is some indirect responsibility there. This point is minor compared to #2, ...2) The film itself is unfairly incomplete. Mel had every intent all along to ONLY show Jesus' crucifixion, and, generally speaking, it was fairly true to scripture, if artistically exaggerated at times. However, while any section of the Bible put to film very well would earn five stars, this is nonetheless a movie, one that deserves critical evaluation from a movie perspective. It was a movie direction decision--not a Bible-documented reality, but a DECISION by Mel Gibson--to refuse to portray some of the pre-crucifixion ministry of Jesus. Granted, there are a few flashbacks during this film that portray the character of Jesus in various key points of his ministry, but these flashbacks are few and far between, buried in an agonizing mush of blood-splattering gore. From a movie critic perspective, despite my love for Jesus, and despite my tearful, full appreciation for what He did for me, nonetheless I would demand that my Jesus be portrayed as more than just some guy who was killed \"like a rose trampled on the ground\". That is so important, yes, but a film about by saviour is incomplete without being a film that is also about my lord and my teacher.Most importantly, I would want a film about the passion of the Word who became flesh to absolutely include profound instances of Him declaring that he is I Am.I do think that the film was well-made for what it attempted to be--a very artistic painting from the mind of one artist that may or may not be fully appreciable by all Christians.Most certainly, this film should NOT be watched by anyone who has not been educated about who this man is or that he claimed to be God the Son who was dying for our sins, and why he was necessary, etc. Most uneducated non-Christians have proven themselves unable to bear watching this gore with enough curiosity to dig deeper and find out what it was all about. All they will see is a terrible murder.And I think it is a terrible act of naivety on the part of my brethren to have expected otherwise.On the other hand, this film certainly does make it easy to identify sheep from goats.

Since I hadn't experienced it by myself I refused to make an opinion out of something I didn't know unlike some others.Finally I saw the film and the word to describe it that comes to my mind is \"extraordinary\".I didn't find anti-Semitism, which is not only something against the philosophy of Christians like me, but also against the very message of the film. The film can be seen as a story of forgiveness, love, sacrifice and faith. Anyone who thinks or perceives the contrary about it, didn't get it. Gibson said this himself and after watching the film, I must agree.But taking the religious controversy aside, the film is both beautiful and brutal. The cinematography is dazzling, the acting is astonishing, the frames are powerful in all senses. The film is in simple terms, a work of cinematographic art.I only found two problems, but  I also understand their reasons.Firstly, there is too much violence and blood. Despite reality must have been like that (or even worst), Gibson took no compassion on the audience and pointed the camera right into the most difficult angle to watch emotionally speaking. His intention was clear, he wanted to ignite a storm of emotions on the viewer (and he succeeded), but personally I think it will take me some time to recover from that before I raise the courage of watching it again. Then again, this film is intended to be an artistic and personal experience, not an entertainment.Secondly, I felt Gibson left me in expectation. He used flashbacks to some of Jesus' teachings. Some of them, like the \"love your enemies, if you only loved the ones that love you, where would the merit be?\" were perfectly handled. But one in particular, the attempt to stone Magdalena, felt to me as if it should have been larger and more specific. I got the message, but I felt left in expectation. The other part, was Jesus' resurrection. A little time devoted to Jesus' contact with his apostles, or perhaps his conversation with Magdalena would have been welcomed. The film would have been around 10 minutes longer, but it would have been more powerful.But in the end, Gibson's intention was to show the last 12 hours, and in that he delivered in a extraordinary way.

You may object, but it is, after all, my opinion and not necessarily yours.Obviously this film was not intended to be entertaining.  And it is not.  The filming, directing and acting are superlative.  I've never seen better.Although the film is based on the New Testament Gospels, which I have read off and on for three-quarters of a century, Mel Gibson took several liberties with the orthodox version of the events surrounding Yeshua's death, which is what the film was designed to portray honestly, as I understand it.I've sold Catholic Bibles, and am familiar with the protestant version as well.  I don't recall any justification for the raven plucking out one of the thieve's eyes on the cross, as it was portrayed in this film.  Also, the appearance of Satan with a reptile in the Garden of Gethsemani was a fictional addition.  It is my understanding, also, that it was Roman practice to drive spikes through the wrist, rather than the palms--although the Bible does mention the resurrected Christ offering Thomas to touch his hand wounds.  The nailed hands would not hold up the crucixion victim, but in this case his wrists were bound to the cross, which would seem to nullify that objection. and it was the custom for the crucifiction victims to carry only the crossbar, rather than an entire cross to the place of execution, as indeed the thieves were shown doing in the film.  Why was He singled out?  Maybe we'll never know the answers to some of these questions.When I was in my mid-twenties, in the best condition of my life, I think that I could not have carried a cross made of six-by-six timbers, of the size depicted, any distance.  I could barely have picked it up, and I was a strong young man.  The cross in the picture was carried by a man who had just been subjected to a scourging and whipping which had left him half dead, and judging by the amount of blood sopped up at the whipping scene by the women (Mary the mother of Yeshua (Jesus, in the Greek translation) and Mary Magdalene, he couldn't have had much blood left in his body, which brings up another problem:  there is no mention in the New Testament of the women doing any such thing...and, why should they have?In the movie, he was tried four times, once by Caiaphas, the High Priest of the Jerusalem temple, once by King Herod, King of Judeaee, and twice by Pontius Pilate, the Roman Procurator.  All in one night and day.  And Herod's palace was not even in Jerusalem, although he may have been there for Passover.  In three of the gospels, the trial by Herod is not mentioned; only the Gospel of John (the last of the canonical Gospels written) refers to it, and does say that he was in Jerusalem.First, he was beat up by the Jewish temple guards, who took him in Gethsemani with the help of Judas Iscariot (liberties were taken with his death scene, also), then Pilate had him flogged near to death (the beating alone, as depicted, would have killed any ordinary man halfway through it), and finally he dragged his cross all the way to Golgotha (with some help).The movie was filled with gratuitous brutality and cruelty not justified to the extent depicted by the accounts in the Christian canonical New Testament Gospels.  In fact, throughout those accounts, the impression is that he was calm and dignified throughout the entire tribulation, until the very last, when he was on the cross.  Even then, he seems to have maintained his composure, even through his pain.  A far cry from the Jesus depicted in this film, I think.Which brings me to my main concern about this movie:  No one can doubt that the Roman's method of capital punishment, crucifixion, was brutal.  It is also written in the canonical Gospels that he, Yeshua, was scourged (whipped, or flogged), which necessarily was also brutal.  But, even so, I, my wife, and the couple with us--although we were expecting to witness brutality--did not expect the horrendous, unspeakable brutality to which we were subjected, nor the heartless jeers and laughing of the Jerusalem crowds and the Romans who were inflicting the torture.  It seemed endless, and unspeakable, comprising most of the movie.  We were unanimous in our opinion that the movie was over the top in its depiction of cruelty.  If the intent was to make the viewers appreciate Christ's suffering for our sake, as they all say, I think it was overdone.  Most of us appreciate it already.This movie will probably win an academy award for filming, acting, directing, and a half-dozen other things.  I repeat: it is not entertainment, nor ia it particularly edifying.  Christians already know the story.  Non-Christians have no reason to see it, and will not appreciate the subtle allusions to certain biblical references.As for the accusations of anti-Semitism, I think any hint of it was overshadowed by the rampant anti-humanism.  The Romans were, by far, the most likeable characters, with the exception of His followers, although they were the ones who inflicted all of the brutality.  There were at least a few of them who showed some humanity.DO NOT take a child to see this film.  I was ready to leave before it was half over, because I had seen enough torture to last me a lifetime, and was not learning anything I didn't already know.I do not find this kind of film entertaining or edifying, and it is an experience that I can do without.  Real life is bad enough, without depicting fictional events that are even worse.Sorry, Mel.  Your heart was undoubtedly in the right place, and technically it was a masterpiece.

An exceedingly, excessively, earnestly personal film. \"Personal\" to the point of autobiography. It is not merely a personal reinterpretation of the Jesus myth, but a hand-wringingly serious APPROPRIATION of that myth for the sake of a deeply personal program.What that \"deeply personal program\" might be, is worth pondering. The film focuses exclusively on the condemnation, scourging, and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth; the rest of his life is bracketed out. We see snapshots of his past in the form of flashbacks. But these flashbacks seem forced. They appear to be designed to make the torture seem relevant, i.e. \"religiously\" meaningful.The film has an INDEPENDENT investment in brutality, in cruelty. One suspects that Gibson has a particular interest in cruelty for cruelty's sake---not for any \"transcendent\" purpose.It is not accidental that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST has horror-film elements: the attack on Judas at the hands of screeching daemon-children, the ubiquitous presence of an androgynous Satan, the demotion of someone-or-other to Hell, etc. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is, sensu stricto, a horror film.Throughout, Jesus's VOLUNTARY assumption of his torture and death is emphasized. One of the strongest images in the film has The Christ embrace his own crucifix as if it were a lover. It is repeatedly stressed in this work that Jesus loves his persecutors, loves his persecutions, and welcomes and affirms his own death.Of course, there is scriptural evidence to support Jesus's affirmation of his own mortality. \"How blest you are, when you suffer insults and persecution and every kind of calumny for my sake. Accept it with gladness and exultation, for you have a rich reward in heaven; in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you\" [Matthew 5:11-12]. Anyone who has read the Gospels and the Gnostic texts, such as THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS, knows that Jesus's persecutors were acting according to a divinely ordained, prestabilized plan -- a plan that Jesus had accepted in advance.The undeniable accent on self-imposed violence, however, exceeds any \"religious\" justification. There is a kind of bloodlust in this film, a joy in the systematic reduction of a human body to dead meat.

First of all the violence in the context of this film was a condemnation of cruelty. It is as it was, and (as bad as it is) , if anything the reality was more brutal than the depiction here. I did not experience the desensitizing of violence as some have described, I felt every blow. There is no pleasure taken in the cruelty on the part of the film. It is too much for kids that may not understand the context and message. (Certainly no one under age should ever see it, and then only some will understand it. It is rated R for a reason.Second the only prejudice in the film is (rightfully) against evil people and the one they serve. Yes, Satan is in the film. Before you say that artistic license was taken, I would assert that Satan being the father of evil is implicitly present where there is cruelty. By including Satan in the depiction, the film makes very bold and brave revelations on the nature of evil. There are profound truths revealed that no other film has addressed so directly and eloquently. Satan appears as a sadistic mocking force of evil that takes many forms but has a hideous similarity in every incarnation. You will notice in your own life that the most cruel people you encounter have that same presence. Another insight into the nature of evil that this film shows is that when a person does evil, Satan does not empower them or protect them, but instead takes as much pleasure in torturing them as he does in torturing the innocent. Those that say there is no message have not only missed all of this, but they have missed the messages of Jesus that are covered in the film.There is an amazing moment when I found myself thinking how shameful and tragic that God should give man the greatest gift and man destroys it, when suddenly the shot is from God's point of view and I am feeling the same as he is. The film is a true artistic triumph as well, with it's amazing cinematography, and in my experience the authentic language helped immerse me in the story.

A truely horrific film on many levels and I wish never to see it again.The film began wonderfully and even engaged me as I watched Jesus make the decisions he knew would take him down the path to his ultimate crucifiction.  However as the film progressed the story, beyond its interpretive problems, grew into a movie of violence. I felt ill watching beating after beating and dramatic fall after dramatic fall.  The realism although technically commendable was beyond gruesome and beyond reasonability.  The story was far overshadowed by Mel Gibson's almost pornographic interest in the visciousness of the experience.To bring a movie goer into the character's pain and visceral anguish is good film making but the level to which Mel Gibson goes takes away so much of the story of the crucifiction.

Indeed, so much controversy has been stirred, it was difficult to watch the picture with an open mind - I knew so much of what to expect.  So, let's begin by addressing the Big Questions.Question #1, Is the film anti-Semitic?  I do not believe so.  It is true that the main villain in the movie is the high-priest Ciaphas.  Some critics have protested that we do not see enough of the reasons for what he does.  He was afraid of stirring up the people and he felt threatened by Jesus.  That said, it is important to realize having reasons for doing a bad thing, does not excuse doing the bad thing.  In this case, a supposed \"holy man,\" a hypocrite, is instrumental in having an innocent man tortured and killed.  The same can be said for Pontius Pilate - yeah, he was trying to keep the peace, but since when is that an excuse for psychotic murder?  Watching The Passion of the Christ, I was reminded of another movie - Schindler's List - in which an evil government used institutionalized torture and murder against the Jews.  True, the Romans were not trying to commit genocide and they did not kill the millions the Nazis did, but the Jews were still subjugated.  The Roman centurions are the real thugs of this movie.Question #2, Is the film violent?  Yes.  It is relentless in its depiction of Christ's torture.  The complaint against most Hollywood Biblical epics is that they are silly, corny, sentimental stories.  NOT THIS ONE.  As soon as the film begins, it is in your face all the way.  Another reviewer has claimed that the violence is \"pornographic\", as if this were a snuff film.  I have seen films with pointless violence - this is not one of them.  People have grown familiar with the story of the Passion and they want it to stay nice, comfortable, and safe.  IT IS NOT.  The thing is that I believe that this is an ACCURATE depiction of what was done to him.  Should we not see the senseless killing in Schindler's List?  The concept that many people cannot grasp is, in movies ABOUT pointless violence, the violence is not pointless.  The entire reason this movie exists is to show what Christ went through.This movie doesn't have an arc in the conventional sense.  It is a docudrama chronicling that last hours of Christ's life.  Jim Caviezel is a robust, manly Jesus.  We can see how he could lead a vast movement.  The film is heavy-handed in places - I was reminded of Jesus Christ Superstar when Herrod was portrayed as a demented drag-queen.Is the film powerful?  Yes, undoubtedly so.  You will be unable to get it out of your head afterwards.  Yet, for all the violence, it is incredibly life-affirming.  Jesus' message - that we all have to love each other - comes through.  When we don't...well, just watch the movie.This film is capable of stirring tremendous religious fervor, and perhaps that's what people are afraid of.  The final image of the film - I won't \"spoil\" it for you, but you should be able to guess - is incredibly uplifting.  It almost has the feel of a superhero moment - inspiring all of us to take up our crosses and continue to fight for good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An open mind...", "unixReviewTime": 1077667200, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2004"}
{"reviewerID": "ARLKYF9JL3QKB", "asin": "0310263662", "reviewerName": "J. SHARP", "helpful": [9, 14], "reviewText": "What the world needs now is one more opinion on Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\", right?I am adding mine because some have asked for it. But, as has been noted hundreds of times over, the movie itself is only part of the experience that is \"The Passion.\" At this point the publicity, the prevailing Church attitude toward movies and celebrity, the accusations of bigotry, the accuracy and theology of the film, and the personality of Mel Gibson are of one cloth with it. So this will be a longer than usual review. It's taken me six months to write it.MEL - As Seattle film critic William Arnold says, \"I've been reading a lot about how Gibson has a martyr complex. I think that's ridiculous. Gibson is less a would-be martyr than a provocateur. There's something in his nature that delights in being abrasive and politically incorrect...He loves to light up a cigarette in places where it's forbidden.\"I agree. Mel loves to goad people then gauge their response.Is that what \"The Passion\" is about? I honestly don't think so. Mel seems to have put an earnest effort into realizing his conception of Christ on film.MARKETING - Of far greater concern to me was the rush of devout, well-meaning Christians to this movie's defense and its propogation - before it was even released. Gibson's passionate creation of this film was an overt mainstream validation that many orthodox Christians had been starving for. His Icon production company leapt on this fact and created an enormous grass-roots marketing campaign that was wildly inexpensive considering the saturation it achieved. With volunteers fanning out across the suburbs bearing posters and leaflets and churches eagerly buying billboards that had Mel's name next to the name of their church, it was probably the biggest publicity coup of the decade.ANTI-SEMITIC? - In my humble Gentile opinion? Not that I can see. Apart from the Romans, virtually every character in the story is a Jew. Besides the disciples, there are good and kind Jews depicted throughout. The Sanhedrin, the religious and civic governing elders, are even conflicted over whether to put Jesus to death, with several arguing against it. Their initiation of His crucifixion to eliminate a religious threat is not a Gibsonian invention, however. It is written in all the gospels. If this film reflects poorly on anyone, it's the Italians. The maddeningly sadistic scourging and crucifixion are their doing. Which brings me to the next point.SHOCKING - One alarming facet of the evangelical reverence of this movie is the prima facie acceptance of the blanching gore and violence that permeate the \"The Passion.\" Most viewers have to shut their eyes at points throughout the film and a few have even left to be sick. Yet some parents (who would never allow their kids to hear a swear word or a discussion on married sex!) took their younger children to it because \"they need to see what Jesus went through.\" This simply floors me. Yes, as a Christian I believe Christ's death and resurrection are the preeminent events in human history and the deciding factor in every human life. But Little Timmy is still wrapping his head around Sunday school stories about the sweet, smiling cartoon Jesus who coddles lambs in his coloring books being killed because Timmy stole his friend's Hot Wheel car and lied about breaking Mom's favorite vase. Although it is true, the concept alone is often confusing and worrisome to them as it is.Am I objecting to an honest and unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering on my behalf? If it evokes repentence, gratitude, and adoration, then not in the least. But if it lingers on it salaciously, then yes. I think that - by and large - this film accomplishes the positive results. But it sometimes veers into the gratuitous, too.I often compare \"The Passion\" to \"Saving Private Ryan.\" That film and its chilling brutality were both an awe-stricken acknowledgement of the sacrifice of the veterans of World War II and a visceral repellant against war itself. It was shocking but vitally necessary. So it can be argued for \"The Passion of the Christ.\" Jesus died a vicious death to rescue all of us. We should be reminded of that and be repelled from taking its cause - our sin - lightly.But young children should not watch either movie. Period. And I hope never to watch them (along with \"Schindler's List\") more than a few times in my life. Any more than that and I might become desensitized to them and thus their central purpose. And that would be unwise.ACCURACY - It gets much of the biblically supported material right. BTW, the dream of Pilate's wife IS in the Bible (Matt. 27:19). The merely interpretive parts are often astonishlingly moving, even if they didn't necessarily happen that way.How does it fare theologically? Depends on your theology. \"The Passion\" makes it clear that Christ died to save the world. The most gutwrenching scene for me was when Jesus stumbles under the cross and tells Mary, \"See, mother. I'm making everything new.\"Those who complain that Gibson has minimized Jesus' message of \"peace, love, and understanding\" in favor of sin and death need to 1) See the movie again and 2) Read the Scriptures again. If Christ's was not the ultimate example of nonviolent conviction, I don't know what is. As the Son of God, He could have struck His executioners dead at any point along the way. But Jesus was not a first-century hippie, either. He spoke more of a literal hell and of complete obedience to God than anyone else in the New Testament. And, honestly, the last twelve hours of His life weren't very conducive to preaching on diversity.This is a decidedly Catholic film. For example, the Stations of the Cross (a sequence of passion events enumerated in the Catholic prayers of the same name) are dutifully enacted, even at risk of creating cinematic redundancy. Mary seems able to locate Jesus through solid rock floors by \"sensing\" Him. But the scenes and events based on the extrabiblical writings of mystics and on later traditions that are regarded as history by some Catholics are alternately distracting and disturbing.BUT IS IT A GOOD MOVIE? - There may be no objective way for me to watch this. I suppose the only way I can answer the question is by rephrasing: Was it a successful movie? Did it have it's intended effect on the audience?Yes.

I mean His stories, mercy and miracle works. There are only little flashes from the past that shows you for exemple the Last Supper and Jesus washing his disciples feet. It would be wise to cut a little Jesus's torturing parts and add little bit Jesus's classical stories.Finally, If you are believer you shoud see this movie immediately because it maybe helps you realise how Jesus suffer to pay our sins.

In that time we, the audience, get to see realistically what Jesus went through according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.Many critics felt the film was overly gory and grotesque in the way the scourging and crucifixion was portrayed.  I beg to differ, the scourging was in line with the way Romans punished criminals, or in this case perceived criminals, and the crucifixion was portrayed very realistically.  To ask Mel Gibson to not show the agony and torture Jesus endured to save mankind, would be a disservice to Mel's beliefs and the beliefs of other Christians, and Jesus himself.  No director has ever shown this level of detail when depicting Christ's sacrifice for us, and that is a testament unto Mel Gibson for being so courageous.\"The Passion of the Christ\" is a brilliantly directed film, and Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus was the most human portrayal of the Savior that I have ever witnessed.  Of course, the story was incredible and stayed faithful to the Biblical accounts in the Gospels.  Do not let the controversy surrounding this film keep you away, I believe everyone should see what Christ went through for us all.\"The Passion of the Christ\" is rated R for violence.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Power, The Glory, The Passion...", "unixReviewTime": 1120608000, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2005"}
